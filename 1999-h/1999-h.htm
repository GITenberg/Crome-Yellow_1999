    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>long this
      particular stretch of line no express had ever passed. All the trains&mdash;the
      few that there were&mdash;stopped at all the stations. Denis knew the
      names of those stations by heart. Bole, Tritton, Spavin Delawarr,
      Knipswich for Timpany, West Bowlby, and, finally, Camlet-on-the-Water.
      Camlet was where he always got out, leaving the train to creep indolently
      onward, goodness only knew whither, into the green heart of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were snorting out of West Bowlby now. It was the next station, thank
      Heaven. Denis took his chattels off the rack and piled them neatly in the
      corner opposite his own. A futile proceeding. But one must have something
      to do. When he had finished, he sank back into his seat and closed his
      eyes. It was extremely hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, this journey! It was two hours cut clean out of his life; two hours in
      which he might have done so much, so much&mdash;written the perfect poem,
      for example, or read the one illuminating book. Instead of which&mdash;his
      gorge rose at the smell of the dusty cushions against which he was
      leaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours. One hundred and twenty minutes. Anything might be done in that
      time. Anything. Nothing. Oh, he had had hundreds of hours, and what had he
      done with them? Wasted them, spilt the precious minutes as though his
      reservoir were inexhaustible. Denis groaned in the spirit, condemned
      himself utterly with all his works. What right had he to sit in the
      sunshine, to occupy corner seats in third-class carriages, to be alive?
      None, none, none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Misery and a nameless nostalgic distress possessed him. He was
      twenty-three, and oh! so agonizingly conscious of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train came bumpingly to a halt. Here was Camlet at last. Denis jumped
      up, crammed his hat over his eyes, deranged his pile of baggage, leaned
      out of the window and shouted for a porter, seized a bag in either hand,
      and had to put them down again in order to open the door. When at last he
      had safely bundled himself and his baggage on to the platform, he ran up
      the train towards the van.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bicycle, a bicycle!&rdquo; he said breathlessly to the guard. He felt himself
      a man of action. The guard paid no attention, but continued methodically
      to hand out, one by one, the packages labelled to Camlet. &ldquo;A bicycle!&rdquo;
       Denis repeated. &ldquo;A green machine, cross-framed, name of Stone. S-T-O-N-E.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time, sir,&rdquo; said the guard soothingly. He was a large,
      stately man with a naval beard. One pictured him at home, drinking tea,
      surrounded by a numerous family. It was in that tone that he must have
      spoken to his children when they were tiresome. &ldquo;All in good time, sir.&rdquo;
       Denis&rsquo;s man of action collapsed, punctured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his luggage to be called for later, and pushed off on his bicycle.
      He always took his bicycle when he went into the country. It was part of
      the theory of exercise. One day one would get up at six o&rsquo;clock and pedal
      away to Kenilworth, or Stratford-on-Avon&mdash;anywhere. And within a
      radius of twenty miles there were always Norman churches and Tudor
      mansions to be seen in the course of an afternoon&rsquo;s excursion. Somehow
      they never did get seen, but all the same it was nice to feel that the
      bicycle was there, and that one fine morning one really might get up at
      six.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once at the top of the long hill which led up from Camlet station, he felt
      his spirits mounting. The world, he found, was good. The far-away blue
      hills, the harvests whitening on the slopes of the ridge along which his
      road led him, the treeless sky-lines that changed as he moved&mdash;yes,
      they were all good. He was overcome by the beauty of those deeply embayed
      combes, scooped in the flanks of the ridge beneath him. Curves, curves: he
      repeated the word slowly, trying as he did so to find some term in which
      to give expression to his appreciation. Curves&mdash;no, that was
      inadequate. He made a gesture with his hand, as though to scoop the
      achieved expression out of the air, and almost fell off his bicycle. What
      was the word to describe the curves of those little valleys? They were as
      fine as the lines of a human body, they were informed with the subtlety of
      art...
    </p>
    <p>
      Galbe. That was a good word; but it was French. Le galbe evase de ses
      hanches: had one ever read a French novel in which that phrase didn&rsquo;t
      occur? Some day he would compile a dictionary for the use of novelists.
      Galbe, gonfle, goulu: parfum, peau, pervers, potele, pudeur: vertu,
      volupte.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he really must find that word. Curves curves...Those little valleys
      had the lines of a cup moulded round a woman&rsquo;s breast; they seemed the
      dinted imprints of some huge divine body that had rested on these hills.
      Cumbrous locutions, these; but through them he seemed to be getting nearer
      to what he wanted. Dinted, dimpled, wimpled&mdash;his mind wandered down
      echoing corridors of assonance and alliteration ever further and further
      from the point. He was enamoured with the beauty of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becoming once more aware of the outer world, he found himself on the crest
      of a descent. The road plunged down, steep and straight, into a
      considerable valley. There, on the opposite slope, a little higher up the
      valley, stood Crome, his destination. He put on his brakes; this view of
      Crome was pleasant to linger over. The facade with its three projecting
      towers rose precipitously from among the dark trees of the garden. The
      house basked in full sunlight; the old brick rosily glowed. How ripe and
      rich it was, how superbly mellow! And at the same time, how austere! The
      hill was becoming steeper and steeper; he was gaining speed in spite of
      his brakes. He loosed his grip of the levers, and in a moment was rushing
      headlong down. Five minutes later he was passing through the gate of the
      great courtyard. The front door stood hospitably open. He left his bicycle
      leaning against the wall and walked in. He would take them by surprise.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e took nobody by
      surprise; there was nobody to take. All was quiet; Denis wandered from
      room to empty room, looking with pleasure at the familiar pictures and
      furniture, at all the little untidy signs of life that lay scattered here
      and there. He was rather glad that they were all out; it was amusing to
      wander through the house as though one were exploring a dead, deserted
      Pompeii. What sort of life would the excavator reconstruct from these
      remains; how would he people these empty chambers? There was the long
      gallery, with its rows of respectable and (though, of course, one couldn&rsquo;t
      publicly admit it) rather boring Italian primitives, its Chinese
      sculptures, its unobtrusive, dateless furniture. There was the panelled
      drawing-room, where the huge chintz-covered arm-chairs stood, oases of
      comfort among the austere flesh-mortifying antiques. There was the
      morning-room, with its pale lemon walls, its painted Venetian chairs and
      rococo tables, its mirrors, its modern pictures. There was the library,
      cool, spacious, and dark, book-lined from floor to ceiling, rich in
      portentous folios. There was the dining-room, solidly, portwinily English,
      with its great mahogany table, its eighteenth-century chairs and
      sideboard, its eighteenth-century pictures&mdash;family portraits,
      meticulous animal paintings. What could one reconstruct from such data?
      There was much of Henry Wimbush in the long gallery and the library,
      something of Anne, perhaps, in the morning-room. That was all. Among the
      accumulations of ten generations the living had left but few traces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying on the table in the morning-room he saw his own book of poems. What
      tact! He picked it up and opened it. It was what the reviewers call &ldquo;a
      slim volume.&rdquo; He read at hazard:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;...But silence and the topless dark
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Vault in the lights of Luna Park;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Blackpool from the nightly gloom
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Hollows a bright tumultuous tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it down again, shook his head, and sighed. &ldquo;What genius I had
      then!&rdquo; he reflected, echoing the aged Swift. It was nearly six months
      since the book had been published; he was glad to think he would never
      write anything of the same sort again. Who could have been reading it, he
      wondered? Anne, perhaps; he liked to think so. Perhaps, too, she had at
      last recognised herself in the Hamadryad of the poplar sapling; the slim
      Hamadryad whose movements were like the swaying of a young tree in the
      wind. &ldquo;The Woman who was a Tree&rdquo; was what he had called the poem. He had
      given her the book when it came out, hoping that the poem would tell her
      what he hadn&rsquo;t dared to say. She had never referred to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut his eyes and saw a vision of her in a red velvet cloak, swaying
      into the little restaurant where they sometimes dined together in London&mdash;three
      quarters of an hour late, and he at his table, haggard with anxiety,
      irritation, hunger. Oh, she was damnable!
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him that perhaps his hostess might be in her boudoir. It
      was a possibility; he would go and see. Mrs. Wimbush&rsquo;s boudoir was in the
      central tower on the garden front. A little staircase cork-screwed up to
      it from the hall. Denis mounted, tapped at the door. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Ah, she
      was there; he had rather hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t be. He opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priscilla Wimbush was lying on the sofa. A blotting-pad rested on her
      knees and she was thoughtfully sucking the end of a silver pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; she said, looking up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten you were coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here I am, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Denis deprecatingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully
      sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wimbush laughed. Her voice, her laughter, were deep and masculine.
      Everything about her was manly. She had a large, square, middle-aged face,
      with a massive projecting nose and little greenish eyes, the whole
      surmounted by a lofty and elaborate coiffure of a curiously improbable
      shade of orange. Looking at her, Denis always thought of Wilkie Bard as
      the cantatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sing in op&rsquo;ra, sing in op&rsquo;ra,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sing in op-pop-pop-pop-pop-popera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Today she was wearing a purple silk dress with a high collar and a row of
      pearls. The costume, so richly dowagerish, so suggestive of the Royal
      Family, made her look more than ever like something on the Halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing all this time?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Denis, and he hesitated, almost voluptuously. He had a
      tremendously amusing account of London and its doings all ripe and ready
      in his mind. It would be a pleasure to give it utterance. &ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo;
       he said...
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was too late. Mrs. Wimbush&rsquo;s question had been what the grammarians
      call rhetorical; it asked for no answer. It was a little conversational
      flourish, a gambit in the polite game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find me busy at my horoscopes,&rdquo; she said, without even being aware
      that she had interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little pained, Denis decided to reserve his story for more receptive
      ears. He contented himself, by way of revenge, with saying &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; rather
      icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I tell you how I won four hundred on the Grand National this year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, still frigid and mono-syllabic. She must have told him
      at least six times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it? Everything is in the Stars. In the Old Days, before
      I had the Stars to help me, I used to lose thousands. Now&rdquo;&mdash;she
      paused an instant&mdash;&ldquo;well, look at that four hundred on the Grand
      National. That&rsquo;s the Stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis would have liked to hear more about the Old Days. But he was too
      discreet and, still more, too shy to ask. There had been something of a
      bust up; that was all he knew. Old Priscilla&mdash;not so old then, of
      course, and sprightlier&mdash;had lost a great deal of money, dropped it
      in handfuls and hatfuls on every race-course in the country. She had
      gambled too. The number of thousands varied in the different legends, but
      all put it high. Henry Wimbush was forced to sell some of his Primitives&mdash;a
      Taddeo da Poggibonsi, an Amico di Taddeo, and four or five nameless
      Sienese&mdash;to the Americans. There was a crisis. For the first time in
      his life Henry asserted himself, and with good effect, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priscilla&rsquo;s gay and gadding existence had come to an abrupt end. Nowadays
      she spent almost all her time at Crome, cultivating a rather ill-defined
      malady. For consolation she dallied with New Thought and the Occult. Her
      passion for racing still possessed her, and Henry, who was a kind-hearted
      fellow at bottom, allowed her forty pounds a month betting money. Most of
      Priscilla&rsquo;s days were spent in casting the horoscopes of horses, and she
      invested her money scientifically, as the stars dictated. She betted on
      football too, and had a large notebook in which she registered the
      horoscopes of all the players in all the teams of the League. The process
      of balancing the horoscopes of two elevens one against the other was a
      very delicate and difficult one. A match between the Spurs and the Villa
      entailed a conflict in the heavens so vast and so complicated that it was
      not to be wondered at if she sometimes made a mistake about the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a pity you don&rsquo;t believe in these things, Denis, such a pity,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Wimbush in her deep, distinct voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I feel it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to have faith. You&rsquo;ve no
      idea how amusing and exciting life becomes when you do believe. All that
      happens means something; nothing you do is ever insignificant. It makes
      life so jolly, you know. Here am I at Crome. Dull as ditchwater, you&rsquo;d
      think; but no, I don&rsquo;t find it so. I don&rsquo;t regret the Old Days a bit. I
      have the Stars...&rdquo; She picked up the sheet of paper that was lying on the
      blotting-pad. &ldquo;Inman&rsquo;s horoscope,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;(I thought I&rsquo;d like to
      have a little fling on the billiards championship this autumn.) I have the
      Infinite to keep in tune with,&rdquo; she waved her hand. &ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s the
      next world and all the spirits, and one&rsquo;s Aura, and Mrs. Eddy and saying
      you&rsquo;re not ill, and the Christian Mysteries and Mrs. Besant. It&rsquo;s all
      splendid. One&rsquo;s never dull for a moment. I can&rsquo;t think how I used to get
      on before&mdash;in the Old Days. Pleasure&mdash;running about, that&rsquo;s all
      it was; just running about. Lunch, tea, dinner, theatre, supper every day.
      It was fun, of course, while it lasted. But there wasn&rsquo;t much left of it
      afterwards. There&rsquo;s rather a good thing about that in Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s new
      book. Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat up and reached for a book that was lying on the little table by
      the head of the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him, by the way?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Barbecue-Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis knew of him vaguely. Barbecue-Smith was a name in the Sunday papers.
      He wrote about the Conduct of Life. He might even be the author of &ldquo;What a
      Young Girl Ought to Know&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not personally,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve invited him for next week-end.&rdquo; She turned over the pages of the
      book. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the passage I was thinking of. I marked it. I always mark
      the things I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holding the book almost at arm&rsquo;s length, for she was somewhat
      long-sighted, and making suitable gestures with her free hand, she began
      to read, slowly, dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What are thousand pound fur coats, what are quarter million incomes?&rsquo;&rdquo;
       She looked up from the page with a histrionic movement of the head; her
      orange coiffure nodded portentously. Denis looked at it, fascinated. Was
      it the Real Thing and henna, he wondered, or was it one of those Complete
      Transformations one sees in the advertisements?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What are Thrones and Sceptres?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The orange Transformation&mdash;yes, it must be a Transformation&mdash;bobbed
      up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What are the gaieties of the Rich, the splendours of the Powerful, what
      is the pride of the Great, what are the gaudy pleasures of High Society?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice, which had risen in tone, questioningly, from sentence to
      sentence, dropped suddenly and boomed reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They are nothing. Vanity, fluff, dandelion seed in the wind, thin
      vapours of fever. The things that matter happen in the heart. Seen things
      are sweet, but those unseen are a thousand times more significant. It is
      the unseen that counts in Life.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wimbush lowered the book. &ldquo;Beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis preferred not to hazard an opinion, but uttered a non-committal
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a fine book this, a beautiful book,&rdquo; said Priscilla, as she let
      the pages flick back, one by one, from under her thumb. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the
      passage about the Lotus Pool. He compares the Soul to a Lotus Pool, you
      know.&rdquo; She held up the book again and read. &ldquo;&lsquo;A Friend of mine has a Lotus
      Pool in his garden. It lies in a little dell embowered with wild roses and
      eglantine, among which the nightingale pours forth its amorous descant all
      the summer long. Within the pool the Lotuses blossom, and the birds of the
      air come to drink and bathe themselves in its crystal waters...&rsquo; Ah, and
      that reminds me,&rdquo; Priscilla exclaimed, shutting the book with a clap and
      uttering her big profound laugh&mdash;&ldquo;that reminds me of the things that
      have been going on in our bathing-pool since you were here last. We gave
      the village people leave to come and bathe here in the evenings. You&rsquo;ve no
      idea of the things that happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward, speaking in a confidential whisper; every now and then
      she uttered a deep gurgle of laughter. &ldquo;...mixed bathing...saw them out of
      my window...sent for a pair of field-glasses to make sure...no doubt of
      it...&rdquo; The laughter broke out again. Denis laughed too. Barbecue-Smith was
      tossed on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we went to see if tea&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; said Priscilla. She hoisted
      herself up from the sofa and went swishing off across the room, striding
      beneath the trailing silk. Denis followed her, faintly humming to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to

    <p class="indent15">
      Sing in op&rsquo;ra, sing in op&rsquo;ra,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sing in op-pop-pop-pop-pop-popera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the little twiddly bit of accompaniment at the end: &ldquo;ra-ra.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he terrace in
      front of the house was a long narrow strip of turf, bounded along its
      outer edge by a graceful stone balustrade. Two little summer-houses of
      brick stood at either end. Below the house the ground sloped very steeply
      away, and the terrace was a remarkably high one; from the balusters to the
      sloping lawn beneath was a drop of thirty feet. Seen from below, the high
      unbroken terrace wall, built like the house itself of brick, had the
      almost menacing aspect of a fortification&mdash;a castle bastion, from
      whose parapet one looked out across airy depths to distances level with
      the eye. Below, in the foreground, hedged in by solid masses of sculptured
      yew trees, lay the stone-brimmed swimming-pool. Beyond it stretched the
      park, with its massive elms, its green expanses of grass, and, at the
      bottom of the valley, the gleam of the narrow river. On the farther side
      of the stream the land rose again in a long slope, chequered with
      cultivation. Looking up the valley, to the right, one saw a line of blue,
      far-off hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-table had been planted in the shade of one of the little
      summer-houses, and the rest of the party was already assembled about it
      when Denis and Priscilla made their appearance. Henry Wimbush had begun to
      pour out the tea. He was one of those ageless, unchanging men on the
      farther side of fifty, who might be thirty, who might be anything. Denis
      had known him almost as long as he could remember. In all those years his
      pale, rather handsome face had never grown any older; it was like the pale
      grey bowler hat which he always wore, winter and summer&mdash;unageing,
      calm, serenely without expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next him, but separated from him and from the rest of the world by the
      almost impenetrable barriers of her deafness, sat Jenny Mullion. She was
      perhaps thirty, had a tilted nose and a pink-and-white complexion, and
      wore her brown hair plaited and coiled in two lateral buns over her ears.
      In the secret tower of her deafness she sat apart, looking down at the
      world through sharply piercing eyes. What did she think of men and women
      and things? That was something that Denis had never been able to discover.
      In her enigmatic remoteness Jenny was a little disquieting. Even now some
      interior joke seemed to be amusing her, for she was smiling to herself,
      and her brown eyes were like very bright round marbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his other side the serious, moonlike innocence of Mary Bracegirdle&rsquo;s
      face shone pink and childish. She was nearly twenty-three, but one
      wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed it. Her short hair, clipped like a page&rsquo;s, hung in a
      bell of elastic gold about her cheeks. She had large blue china eyes,
      whose expression was one of ingenuous and often puzzled earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to Mary a small gaunt man was sitting, rigid and erect in his chair.
      In appearance Mr. Scogan was like one of those extinct bird-lizards of the
      Tertiary. His nose was beaked, his dark eye had the shining quickness of a
      robin&rsquo;s. But there was nothing soft or gracious or feathery about him. The
      skin of his wrinkled brown face had a dry and scaly look; his hands were
      the hands of a crocodile. His movements were marked by the lizard&rsquo;s
      disconcertingly abrupt clockwork speed; his speech was thin, fluty, and
      dry. Henry Wimbush&rsquo;s school-fellow and exact contemporary, Mr. Scogan
      looked far older and, at the same time, far more youthfully alive than did
      that gentle aristocrat with the face like a grey bowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan might look like an extinct saurian, but Gombauld was altogether
      and essentially human. In the old-fashioned natural histories of the
      &lsquo;thirties he might have figured in a steel engraving as a type of Homo
      Sapiens&mdash;an honour which at that time commonly fell to Lord Byron.
      Indeed, with more hair and less collar, Gombauld would have been
      completely Byronic&mdash;more than Byronic, even, for Gombauld was of
      Provencal descent, a black-haired young corsair of thirty, with flashing
      teeth and luminous large dark eyes. Denis looked at him enviously. He was
      jealous of his talent: if only he wrote verse as well as Gombauld painted
      pictures! Still more, at the moment, he envied Gombauld his looks, his
      vitality, his easy confidence of manner. Was it surprising that Anne
      should like him? Like him?&mdash;it might even be something worse, Denis
      reflected bitterly, as he walked at Priscilla&rsquo;s side down the long grass
      terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Gombauld and Mr. Scogan a very much lowered deck-chair presented
      its back to the new arrivals as they advanced towards the tea-table.
      Gombauld was leaning over it; his face moved vivaciously; he smiled, he
      laughed, he made quick gestures with his hands. From the depths of the
      chair came up a sound of soft, lazy laughter. Denis started as he heard
      it. That laughter&mdash;how well he knew it! What emotions it evoked in
      him! He quickened his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her low deck-chair Anne was nearer to lying than to sitting. Her long,
      slender body reposed in an attitude of listless and indolent grace. Within
      its setting of light brown hair her face had a pretty regularity that was
      almost doll-like. And indeed there were moments when she seemed nothing
      more than a doll; when the oval face, with its long-lashed, pale blue
      eyes, expressed nothing; when it was no more than a lazy mask of wax. She
      was Henry Wimbush&rsquo;s own niece; that bowler-like countenance was one of the
      Wimbush heirlooms; it ran in the family, appearing in its female members
      as a blank doll-face. But across this dollish mask, like a gay melody
      dancing over an unchanging fundamental bass, passed Anne&rsquo;s other
      inheritance&mdash;quick laughter, light ironic amusement, and the changing
      expressions of many moods. She was smiling now as Denis looked down at
      her: her cat&rsquo;s smile, he called it, for no very good reason. The mouth was
      compressed, and on either side of it two tiny wrinkles had formed
      themselves in her cheeks. An infinity of slightly malicious amusement
      lurked in those little folds, in the puckers about the half-closed eyes,
      in the eyes themselves, bright and laughing between the narrowed lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preliminary greetings spoken, Denis found an empty chair between
      Gombauld and Jenny and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Jenny?&rdquo; he shouted to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny nodded and smiled in mysterious silence, as though the subject of
      her health were a secret that could not be publicly divulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s London been since I went away?&rdquo; Anne inquired from the depth of her
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment had come; the tremendously amusing narrative was waiting for
      utterance. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Denis, smiling happily, &ldquo;to begin with...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Priscilla told you of our great antiquarian find?&rdquo; Henry Wimbush
      leaned forward; the most promising of buds was nipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo; said Denis desperately, &ldquo;there was the Ballet...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last week,&rdquo; Mr. Wimbush went on softly and implacably, &ldquo;we dug up fifty
      yards of oaken drain-pipes; just tree trunks with a hole bored through the
      middle. Very interesting indeed. Whether they were laid down by the monks
      in the fifteenth century, or whether...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis listened gloomily. &ldquo;Extraordinary!&rdquo; he said, when Mr. Wimbush had
      finished; &ldquo;quite extraordinary!&rdquo; He helped himself to another slice of
      cake. He didn&rsquo;t even want to tell his tale about London now; he was
      damped.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time past Mary&rsquo;s grave blue eyes had been fixed upon him. &ldquo;What
      have you been writing lately?&rdquo; she asked. It would be nice to have a
      little literary conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, verse and prose,&rdquo; said Denis&mdash;&ldquo;just verse and prose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prose?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan pounced alarmingly on the word. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been writing
      prose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a novel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Denis!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis felt rather uncomfortable. &ldquo;Oh, about the usual things, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan groaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll describe the plot for you. Little
      Percy, the hero, was never good at games, but he was always clever. He
      passes through the usual public school and the usual university and comes
      to London, where he lives among the artists. He is bowed down with
      melancholy thought; he carries the whole weight of the universe upon his
      shoulders. He writes a novel of dazzling brilliance; he dabbles delicately
      in Amour and disappears, at the end of the book, into the luminous
      Future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis blushed scarlet. Mr. Scogan had described the plan of his novel with
      an accuracy that was appalling. He made an effort to laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      entirely wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My novel is not in the least like that.&rdquo; It was
      a heroic lie. Luckily, he reflected, only two chapters were written. He
      would tear them up that very evening when he unpacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan paid no attention to his denial, but went on: &ldquo;Why will you
      young men continue to write about things that are so entirely
      uninteresting as the mentality of adolescents and artists? Professional
      anthropologists might find it interesting to turn sometimes from the
      beliefs of the Blackfellow to the philosophical preoccupations of the
      undergraduate. But you can&rsquo;t expect an ordinary adult man, like myself, to
      be much moved by the story of his spiritual troubles. And after all, even
      in England, even in Germany and Russia, there are more adults than
      adolescents. As for the artist, he is preoccupied with problems that are
      so utterly unlike those of the ordinary adult man&mdash;problems of pure
      aesthetics which don&rsquo;t so much as present themselves to people like myself&mdash;that
      a description of his mental processes is as boring to the ordinary reader
      as a piece of pure mathematics. A serious book about artists regarded as
      artists is unreadable; and a book about artists regarded as lovers,
      husbands, dipsomaniacs, heroes, and the like is really not worth writing
      again. Jean-Christophe is the stock artist of literature, just as
      Professor Radium of &lsquo;Comic Cuts&rsquo; is its stock man of science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear I&rsquo;m as uninteresting as all that,&rdquo; said Gombauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear Gombauld,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan hastened to explain. &ldquo;As a
      lover or a dipsomaniac, I&rsquo;ve no doubt of your being a most fascinating
      specimen. But as a combiner of forms, you must honestly admit it, you&rsquo;re a
      bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entirely disagree with you,&rdquo; exclaimed Mary. She was somehow always out
      of breath when she talked. And her speech was punctuated by little gasps.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known a great many artists, and I&rsquo;ve always found their mentality
      very interesting. Especially in Paris. Tschuplitski, for example&mdash;I
      saw a great deal of Tschuplitski in Paris this spring...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but then you&rsquo;re an exception, Mary, you&rsquo;re an exception,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Scogan. &ldquo;You are a femme superieure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush of pleasure turned Mary&rsquo;s face into a harvest moon.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>enis woke up next
      morning to find the sun shining, the sky serene. He decided to wear white
      flannel trousers&mdash;white flannel trousers and a black jacket, with a
      silk shirt and his new peach-coloured tie. And what shoes? White was the
      obvious choice, but there was something rather pleasing about the notion
      of black patent leather. He lay in bed for several minutes considering the
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he went down&mdash;patent leather was his final choice&mdash;he
      looked at himself critically in the glass. His hair might have been more
      golden, he reflected. As it was, its yellowness had the hint of a greenish
      tinge in it. But his forehead was good. His forehead made up in height
      what his chin lacked in prominence. His nose might have been longer, but
      it would pass. His eyes might have been blue and not green. But his coat
      was very well cut and, discreetly padded, made him seem robuster than he
      actually was. His legs, in their white casing, were long and elegant.
      Satisfied, he descended the stairs. Most of the party had already finished
      their breakfast. He found himself alone with Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you slept well,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo; Jenny replied, giving two rapid little nods. &ldquo;But
      we had such awful thunderstorms last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parallel straight lines, Denis reflected, meet only at infinity. He might
      talk for ever of care-charmer sleep and she of meteorology till the end of
      time. Did one ever establish contact with anyone? We are all parallel
      straight lines. Jenny was only a little more parallel than most.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very alarming, these thunderstorms,&rdquo; he said, helping himself to
      porridge. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so? Or are you above being frightened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I always go to bed in a storm. One is so much safer lying down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Jenny, making a descriptive gesture, &ldquo;because lightning
      goes downwards and not flat ways. When you&rsquo;re lying down you&rsquo;re out of the
      current.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very ingenious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Denis finished his porridge and helped himself to
      bacon. For lack of anything better to say, and because Mr. Scogan&rsquo;s absurd
      phrase was for some reason running in his head, he turned to Jenny and
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you consider yourself a femme superieure?&rdquo; He had to repeat the
      question several times before Jenny got the hang of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, rather indignantly, when at last she heard what Denis was
      saying. &ldquo;Certainly not. Has anyone been suggesting that I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;Mr. Scogan told Mary she was one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; Jenny lowered her voice. &ldquo;Shall I tell you what I think of that
      man? I think he&rsquo;s slightly sinister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having made this pronouncement, she entered the ivory tower of her
      deafness and closed the door. Denis could not induce her to say anything
      more, could not induce her even to listen. She just smiled at him, smiled
      and occasionally nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis went out on to the terrace to smoke his after-breakfast pipe and to
      read his morning paper. An hour later, when Anne came down, she found him
      still reading. By this time he had got to the Court Circular and the
      Forthcoming Weddings. He got up to meet her as she approached, a Hamadryad
      in white muslin, across the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Denis,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you look perfectly sweet in your white
      trousers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis was dreadfully taken aback. There was no possible retort. &ldquo;You speak
      as though I were a child in a new frock,&rdquo; he said, with a show of
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s how I feel about you, Denis dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m so much older than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Four years older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you do look perfectly sweet in your white trousers, why shouldn&rsquo;t
      I say so? And why did you put them on, if you didn&rsquo;t think you were going
      to look sweet in them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the garden,&rdquo; said Denis. He was put out; the conversation
      had taken such a preposterous and unexpected turn. He had planned a very
      different opening, in which he was to lead off with, &ldquo;You look adorable
      this morning,&rdquo; or something of the kind, and she was to answer, &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
       and then there was to be a pregnant silence. And now she had got in first
      with the trousers. It was provoking; his pride was hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      That part of the garden that sloped down from the foot of the terrace to
      the pool had a beauty which did not depend on colour so much as on forms.
      It was as beautiful by moonlight as in the sun. The silver of water, the
      dark shapes of yew and ilex trees remained, at all hours and seasons, the
      dominant features of the scene. It was a landscape in black and white. For
      colour there was the flower-garden; it lay to one side of the pool,
      separated from it by a huge Babylonian wall of yews. You passed through a
      tunnel in the hedge, you opened a wicket in a wall, and you found
      yourself, startlingly and suddenly, in the world of colour. The July
      borders blazed and flared under the sun. Within its high brick walls the
      garden was like a great tank of warmth and perfume and colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis held open the little iron gate for his companion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like passing
      from a cloister into an Oriental palace,&rdquo; he said, and took a deep breath
      of the warm, flower-scented air. &ldquo;&lsquo;In fragrant volleys they let fly...&rsquo; 
      How does it go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well shot, ye firemen! Oh how sweet
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And round your equal fires do meet;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whose shrill report no ear can tell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But echoes to the eye and smell...&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a bad habit of quoting,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;As I never know the context
      or author, I find it humiliating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis apologized. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fault of one&rsquo;s education. Things somehow seem
      more real and vivid when one can apply somebody else&rsquo;s ready-made phrase
      about them. And then there are lots of lovely names and words&mdash;Monophysite,
      Iamblichus, Pomponazzi; you bring them out triumphantly, and feel you&rsquo;ve
      clinched the argument with the mere magical sound of them. That&rsquo;s what
      comes of the higher education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may regret your education,&rdquo; said Anne; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of my lack of it.
      Look at those sunflowers! Aren&rsquo;t they magnificent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dark faces and golden crowns&mdash;they&rsquo;re kings of Ethiopia. And I like
      the way the tits cling to the flowers and pick out the seeds, while the
      other loutish birds, grubbing dirtily for their food, look up in envy from
      the ground. Do they look up in envy? That&rsquo;s the literary touch, I&rsquo;m
      afraid. Education again. It always comes back to that.&rdquo; He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne had sat down on a bench that stood in the shade of an old apple tree.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not sit down, but walked backwards and forwards in front of the
      bench, gesticulating a little as he talked. &ldquo;Books,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;books.
      One reads so many, and one sees so few people and so little of the world.
      Great thick books about the universe and the mind and ethics. You&rsquo;ve no
      idea how many there are. I must have read twenty or thirty tons of them in
      the last five years. Twenty tons of ratiocination. Weighted with that,
      one&rsquo;s pushed out into the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on walking up and down. His voice rose, fell, was silent a moment,
      and then talked on. He moved his hands, sometimes he waved his arms. Anne
      looked and listened quietly, as though she were at a lecture. He was a
      nice boy, and to-day he looked charming&mdash;charming!
    </p>
    <p>
      One entered the world, Denis pursued, having ready-made ideas about
      everything. One had a philosophy and tried to make life fit into it. One
      should have lived first and then made one&rsquo;s philosophy to fit life...Life,
      facts, things were horribly complicated; ideas, even the most difficult of
      them, deceptively simple. In the world of ideas everything was clear; in
      life all was obscure, embroiled. Was it surprising that one was miserable,
      horribly unhappy? Denis came to a halt in front of the bench, and as he
      asked this last question he stretched out his arms and stood for an
      instant in an attitude of crucifixion, then let them fall again to his
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Denis!&rdquo; Anne was touched. He was really too pathetic as he stood
      there in front of her in his white flannel trousers. &ldquo;But does one suffer
      about these things? It seems very extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like Scogan,&rdquo; cried Denis bitterly. &ldquo;You regard me as a specimen
      for an anthropologist. Well, I suppose I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested, and drew in her skirt with a gesture that
      indicated that he was to sit down beside her. He sat down. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you
      just take things for granted and as they come?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much
      simpler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a lesson to be learnt gradually.
      There are the twenty tons of ratiocination to be got rid of first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always taken things as they come,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;It seems so obvious.
      One enjoys the pleasant things, avoids the nasty ones. There&rsquo;s nothing
      more to be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;for you. But, then, you were born a pagan; I am trying
      laboriously to make myself one. I can take nothing for granted, I can
      enjoy nothing as it comes along. Beauty, pleasure, art, women&mdash;I have
      to invent an excuse, a justification for everything that&rsquo;s delightful.
      Otherwise I can&rsquo;t enjoy it with an easy conscience. I make up a little
      story about beauty and pretend that it has something to do with truth and
      goodness. I have to say that art is the process by which one reconstructs
      the divine reality out of chaos. Pleasure is one of the mystical roads to
      union with the infinite&mdash;the ecstasies of drinking, dancing,
      love-making. As for women, I am perpetually assuring myself that they&rsquo;re
      the broad highway to divinity. And to think that I&rsquo;m only just beginning
      to see through the silliness of the whole thing! It&rsquo;s incredible to me
      that anyone should have escaped these horrors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still more incredible to me,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;that anyone should have
      been a victim to them. I should like to see myself believing that men are
      the highway to divinity.&rdquo; The amused malice of her smile planted two
      little folds on either side of her mouth, and through their half-closed
      lids her eyes shone with laughter. &ldquo;What you need, Denis, is a nice plump
      young wife, a fixed income, and a little congenial but regular work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I need is you.&rdquo; That was what he ought to have retorted, that was
      what he wanted passionately to say. He could not say it. His desire fought
      against his shyness. &ldquo;What I need is you.&rdquo; Mentally he shouted the words,
      but not a sound issued from his lips. He looked at her despairingly.
      Couldn&rsquo;t she see what was going on inside him? Couldn&rsquo;t she understand?
      &ldquo;What I need is you.&rdquo; He would say it, he would&mdash;he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall go and bathe,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hot.&rdquo; The opportunity
      had passed.

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Wimbush had
      taken them to see the sights of the Home Farm, and now they were standing,
      all six of them&mdash;Henry Wimbush, Mr. Scogan, Denis, Gombauld, Anne,
      and Mary&mdash;by the low wall of the piggery, looking into one of the
      styes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a good sow,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush. &ldquo;She had a litter of fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen?&rdquo; Mary echoed incredulously. She turned astonished blue eyes
      towards Mr. Wimbush, then let them fall onto the seething mass of elan
      vital that fermented in the sty.
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense sow reposed on her side in the middle of the pen. Her round,
      black belly, fringed with a double line of dugs, presented itself to the
      assault of an army of small, brownish-black swine. With a frantic greed
      they tugged at their mother&rsquo;s flank. The old sow stirred sometimes
      uneasily or uttered a little grunt of pain. One small pig, the runt, the
      weakling of the litter, had been unable to secure a place at the banquet.
      Squealing shrilly, he ran backwards and forwards, trying to push in among
      his stronger brothers or even to climb over their tight little black backs
      towards the maternal reservoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ARE fourteen,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right. I counted. It&rsquo;s
      extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sow next door,&rdquo; Mr. Wimbush went on, &ldquo;has done very badly. She only
      had five in her litter. I shall give her another chance. If she does no
      better next time, I shall fat her up and kill her. There&rsquo;s the boar,&rdquo; he
      pointed towards a farther sty. &ldquo;Fine old beast, isn&rsquo;t he? But he&rsquo;s getting
      past his prime. He&rsquo;ll have to go too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cruel!&rdquo; Anne exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how practical, how eminently realistic!&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;In this
      farm we have a model of sound paternal government. Make them breed, make
      them work, and when they&rsquo;re past working or breeding or begetting,
      slaughter them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farming seems to be mostly indecency and cruelty,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the ferrule of his walking-stick Denis began to scratch the boar&rsquo;s
      long bristly back. The animal moved a little so as to bring himself within
      easier range of the instrument that evoked in him such delicious
      sensations; then he stood stock still, softly grunting his contentment.
      The mud of years flaked off his sides in a grey powdery scurf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pleasure it is,&rdquo; said Denis, &ldquo;to do somebody a kindness. I believe
      I enjoy scratching this pig quite as much as he enjoys being scratched. If
      only one could always be kind with so little expense or trouble...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gate slammed; there was a sound of heavy footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Rowley!&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, sir,&rdquo; old Rowley answered. He was the most venerable of the
      labourers on the farm&mdash;a tall, solid man, still unbent, with grey
      side-whiskers and a steep, dignified profile. Grave, weighty in his
      manner, splendidly respectable, Rowley had the air of a great English
      statesman of the mid-nineteenth century. He halted on the outskirts of the
      group, and for a moment they all looked at the pigs in a silence that was
      only broken by the sound of grunting or the squelch of a sharp hoof in the
      mire. Rowley turned at last, slowly and ponderously and nobly, as he did
      everything, and addressed himself to Henry Wimbush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at them, sir,&rdquo; he said, with a motion of his hand towards the
      wallowing swine. &ldquo;Rightly is they called pigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rightly indeed,&rdquo; Mr. Wimbush agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am abashed by that man,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, as old Rowley plodded off
      slowly and with dignity. &ldquo;What wisdom, what judgment, what a sense of
      values! &lsquo;Rightly are they called swine.&rsquo; Yes. And I wish I could, with as
      much justice, say, &lsquo;Rightly are we called men.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on towards the cowsheds and the stables of the cart-horses.
      Five white geese, taking the air this fine morning, even as they were
      doing, met them in the way. They hesitated, cackled; then, converting
      their lifted necks into rigid, horizontal snakes, they rushed off in
      disorder, hissing horribly as they went. Red calves paddled in the dung
      and mud of a spacious yard. In another enclosure stood the bull, massive
      as a locomotive. He was a very calm bull, and his face wore an expression
      of melancholy stupidity. He gazed with reddish-brown eyes at his visitors,
      chewed thoughtfully at the tangible memories of an earlier meal, swallowed
      and regurgitated, chewed again. His tail lashed savagely from side to
      side; it seemed to have nothing to do with his impassive bulk. Between his
      short horns was a triangle of red curls, short and dense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid animal,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush. &ldquo;Pedigree stock. But he&rsquo;s getting a
      little old, like the boar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fat him up and slaughter him,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan pronounced, with a delicate
      old-maidish precision of utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you give the animals a little holiday from producing children?&rdquo;
       asked Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for the poor things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wimbush shook his head. &ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I rather like seeing
      fourteen pigs grow where only one grew before. The spectacle of so much
      crude life is refreshing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; Gombauld broke in warmly. &ldquo;Lots of life:
      that&rsquo;s what we want. I like pullulation; everything ought to increase and
      multiply as hard as it can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld grew lyrical. Everybody ought to have children&mdash;Anne ought
      to have them, Mary ought to have them&mdash;dozens and dozens. He
      emphasised his point by thumping with his walking-stick on the bull&rsquo;s
      leather flanks. Mr. Scogan ought to pass on his intelligence to little
      Scogans, and Denis to little Denises. The bull turned his head to see what
      was happening, regarded the drumming stick for several seconds, then
      turned back again satisfied, it seemed, that nothing was happening.
      Sterility was odious, unnatural, a sin against life. Life, life, and still
      more life. The ribs of the placid bull resounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing with his back against the farmyard pump, a little apart, Denis
      examined the group. Gombauld, passionate and vivacious, was its centre.
      The others stood round, listening&mdash;Henry Wimbush, calm and polite
      beneath his grey bowler; Mary, with parted lips and eyes that shone with
      the indignation of a convinced birth-controller. Anne looked on through
      half-shut eyes, smiling; and beside her stood Mr. Scogan, bolt upright in
      an attitude of metallic rigidity that contrasted strangely with that fluid
      grace of hers which even in stillness suggested a soft movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld ceased talking, and Mary, flushed and outraged, opened her mouth
      to refute him. But she was too slow. Before she could utter a word Mr.
      Scogan&rsquo;s fluty voice had pronounced the opening phrases of a discourse.
      There was no hope of getting so much as a word in edgeways; Mary had
      perforce to resign herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even your eloquence, my dear Gombauld,&rdquo; he was saying&mdash;&ldquo;even your
      eloquence must prove inadequate to reconvert the world to a belief in the
      delights of mere multiplication. With the gramophone, the cinema, and the
      automatic pistol, the goddess of Applied Science has presented the world
      with another gift, more precious even than these&mdash;the means of
      dissociating love from propagation. Eros, for those who wish it, is now an
      entirely free god; his deplorable associations with Lucina may be broken
      at will. In the course of the next few centuries, who knows? the world may
      see a more complete severance. I look forward to it optimistically. Where
      the great Erasmus Darwin and Miss Anna Seward, Swan of Lichfield,
      experimented&mdash;and, for all their scientific ardour, failed&mdash;our
      descendants will experiment and succeed. An impersonal generation will
      take the place of Nature&rsquo;s hideous system. In vast state incubators, rows
      upon rows of gravid bottles will supply the world with the population it
      requires. The family system will disappear; society, sapped at its very
      base, will have to find new foundations; and Eros, beautifully and
      irresponsibly free, will flit like a gay butterfly from flower to flower
      through a sunlit world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds lovely,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The distant future always does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s china blue eyes, more serious and more astonished than ever, were
      fixed on Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;Bottles?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you really think so?
      Bottles...&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Barbecue-Smith
      arrived in time for tea on Saturday afternoon. He was a short and
      corpulent man, with a very large head and no neck. In his earlier middle
      age he had been distressed by this absence of neck, but was comforted by
      reading in Balzac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Louis Lambert&rdquo; that all the world&rsquo;s great men have
      been marked by the same peculiarity, and for a simple and obvious reason:
      Greatness is nothing more nor less than the harmonious functioning of the
      faculties of the head and heart; the shorter the neck, the more closely
      these two organs approach one another; argal...It was convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbecue-Smith belonged to the old school of journalists. He sported a
      leonine head with a greyish-black mane of oddly unappetising hair brushed
      back from a broad but low forehead. And somehow he always seemed slightly,
      ever so slightly, soiled. In younger days he had gaily called himself a
      Bohemian. He did so no longer. He was a teacher now, a kind of prophet.
      Some of his books of comfort and spiritual teaching were in their hundred
      and twentieth thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priscilla received him with every mark of esteem. He had never been to
      Crome before; she showed him round the house. Mr. Barbecue-Smith was full
      of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So quaint, so old-world,&rdquo; he kept repeating. He had a rich, rather
      unctuous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priscilla praised his latest book. &ldquo;Splendid, I thought it was,&rdquo; she said
      in her large, jolly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to think you found it a comfort,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tremendously! And the bit about the Lotus Pool&mdash;I thought that
      so beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would like that. It came to me, you know, from without.&rdquo; He
      waved his hand to indicate the astral world.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out into the garden for tea. Mr. Barbecue-Smith was duly
      introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stone is a writer too,&rdquo; said Priscilla, as she introduced Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Mr. Barbecue-Smith smiled benignly, and, looking up at Denis
      with an expression of Olympian condescension, &ldquo;And what sort of things do
      you write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis was furious, and, to make matters worse, he felt himself blushing
      hotly. Had Priscilla no sense of proportion? She was putting them in the
      same category&mdash;Barbecue-Smith and himself. They were both writers,
      they both used pen and ink. To Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s question he answered,
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing much, nothing,&rdquo; and looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stone is one of our younger poets.&rdquo; It was Anne&rsquo;s voice. He scowled
      at her, and she smiled back exasperatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, excellent,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith, and he squeezed Denis&rsquo;s
      arm encouragingly. &ldquo;The Bard&rsquo;s is a noble calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as tea was over Mr. Barbecue-Smith excused himself; he had to do
      some writing before dinner. Priscilla quite understood. The prophet
      retired to his chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbecue-Smith came down to the drawing-room at ten to eight. He was
      in a good humour, and, as he descended the stairs, he smiled to himself
      and rubbed his large white hands together. In the drawing-room someone was
      playing softly and ramblingly on the piano. He wondered who it could be.
      One of the young ladies, perhaps. But no, it was only Denis, who got up
      hurriedly and with some embarrassment as he came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go on, do go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. &ldquo;I am very fond of music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I couldn&rsquo;t possibly go on,&rdquo; Denis replied. &ldquo;I only make noises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Mr. Barbecue-Smith stood with his back to the hearth,
      warming himself at the memory of last winter&rsquo;s fires. He could not control
      his interior satisfaction, but still went on smiling to himself. At last
      he turned to Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You write,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;a little, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many words do you find you can write in an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever counted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you ought to, you ought to. It&rsquo;s most important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis exercised his memory. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m in good form,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I fancy I
      do a twelve-hundred-word review in about four hours. But sometimes it
      takes me much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbecue-Smith nodded. &ldquo;Yes, three hundred words an hour at your
      best.&rdquo; He walked out into the middle of the room, turned round on his
      heels, and confronted Denis again. &ldquo;Guess how many words I wrote this
      evening between five and half-past seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you must guess. Between five and half-past seven&mdash;that&rsquo;s two
      and a half hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve hundred words,&rdquo; Denis hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo; Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s expanded face shone with gaiety. &ldquo;Try
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; said Denis. He found he couldn&rsquo;t summon up much interest
      in Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. Three thousand eight hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis opened his eyes. &ldquo;You must get a lot done in a day,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbecue-Smith suddenly became extremely confidential. He pulled up a
      stool to the side of Denis&rsquo;s arm-chair, sat down in it, and began to talk
      softly and rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he said, laying his hand on Denis&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;You want to
      make your living by writing; you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re inexperienced. Let me
      give you a little sound advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was the fellow going to do? Denis wondered: give him an introduction
      to the editor of &ldquo;John o&rsquo; London&rsquo;s Weekly&rdquo;, or tell him where he could
      sell a light middle for seven guineas? Mr. Barbecue-Smith patted his arm
      several times and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The secret of writing,&rdquo; he said, breathing it into the young man&rsquo;s ear&mdash;&ldquo;the
      secret of writing is Inspiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis looked at him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspiration...&rdquo; Mr. Barbecue-Smith repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the native wood-note business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbecue-Smith nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then I entirely agree with you,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;But what if one hasn&rsquo;t
      got Inspiration?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was precisely the question I was waiting for,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Barbecue-Smith. &ldquo;You ask me what one should do if one hasn&rsquo;t got
      Inspiration. I answer: you have Inspiration; everyone has Inspiration.
      It&rsquo;s simply a question of getting it to function.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck eight. There was no sign of any of the other guests;
      everybody was always late at Crome. Mr. Barbecue-Smith went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my secret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I give it you freely.&rdquo; (Denis made a
      suitably grateful murmur and grimace.) &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you to find your
      Inspiration, because I don&rsquo;t like to see a nice, steady young man like you
      exhausting his vitality and wasting the best years of his life in a
      grinding intellectual labour that could be completely obviated by
      Inspiration. I did it myself, so I know what it&rsquo;s like. Up till the time I
      was thirty-eight I was a writer like you&mdash;a writer without
      Inspiration. All I wrote I squeezed out of myself by sheer hard work. Why,
      in those days I was never able to do more than six-fifty words an hour,
      and what&rsquo;s more, I often didn&rsquo;t sell what I wrote.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;We
      artists,&rdquo; he said parenthetically, &ldquo;we intellectuals aren&rsquo;t much
      appreciated here in England.&rdquo; Denis wondered if there was any method,
      consistent, of course, with politeness, by which he could dissociate
      himself from Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;we.&rdquo; There was none; and besides, it
      was too late now, for Mr. Barbecue-Smith was once more pursuing the tenor
      of his discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At thirty-eight I was a poor, struggling, tired, overworked, unknown
      journalist. Now, at fifty...&rdquo; He paused modestly and made a little
      gesture, moving his fat hands outwards, away from one another, and
      expanding his fingers as though in demonstration. He was exhibiting
      himself. Denis thought of that advertisement of Nestle&rsquo;s milk&mdash;the
      two cats on the wall, under the moon, one black and thin, the other white,
      sleek, and fat. Before Inspiration and after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspiration has made the difference,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith solemnly.
      &ldquo;It came quite suddenly&mdash;like a gentle dew from heaven.&rdquo; He lifted
      his hand and let it fall back on to his knee to indicate the descent of
      the dew. &ldquo;It was one evening. I was writing my first little book about the
      Conduct of Life&mdash;&lsquo;Humble Heroisms&rsquo;. You may have read it; it has been
      a comfort&mdash;at least I hope and think so&mdash;a comfort to many
      thousands. I was in the middle of the second chapter, and I was stuck.
      Fatigue, overwork&mdash;I had only written a hundred words in the last
      hour, and I could get no further. I sat biting the end of my pen and
      looking at the electric light, which hung above my table, a little above
      and in front of me.&rdquo; He indicated the position of the lamp with elaborate
      care. &ldquo;Have you ever looked at a bright light intently for a long time?&rdquo;
       he asked, turning to Denis. Denis didn&rsquo;t think he had. &ldquo;You can hypnotise
      yourself that way,&rdquo; Mr. Barbecue-Smith went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gong sounded in a terrific crescendo from the hall. Still no sign of
      the others. Denis was horribly hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happened to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. &ldquo;I was hypnotised.
      I lost consciousness like that.&rdquo; He snapped his fingers. &ldquo;When I came to,
      I found that it was past midnight, and I had written four thousand words.
      Four thousand,&rdquo; he repeated, opening his mouth very wide on the &ldquo;ou&rdquo; of
      thousand. &ldquo;Inspiration had come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a very extraordinary thing,&rdquo; said Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid of it at first. It didn&rsquo;t seem to me natural. I didn&rsquo;t feel,
      somehow, that it was quite right, quite fair, I might almost say, to
      produce a literary composition unconsciously. Besides, I was afraid I
      might have written nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had you written nonsense?&rdquo; Denis asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Mr. Barbecue-Smith replied, with a trace of annoyance.
      &ldquo;Certainly not. It was admirable. Just a few spelling mistakes and slips,
      such as there generally are in automatic writing. But the style, the
      thought&mdash;all the essentials were admirable. After that, Inspiration
      came to me regularly. I wrote the whole of &lsquo;Humble Heroisms&rsquo; like that. It
      was a great success, and so has everything been that I have written
      since.&rdquo; He leaned forward and jabbed at Denis with his finger. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my
      secret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s how you could write too, if you tried&mdash;without
      effort, fluently, well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; asked Denis, trying not to show how deeply he had been insulted
      by that final &ldquo;well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By cultivating your Inspiration, by getting into touch with your
      Subconscious. Have you ever read my little book, &lsquo;Pipe-Lines to the
      Infinite&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis had to confess that that was, precisely, one of the few, perhaps the
      only one, of Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s works he had not read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, never mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little
      book about the connection of the Subconscious with the Infinite. Get into
      touch with the Subconscious and you are in touch with the Universe.
      Inspiration, in fact. You follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, perfectly,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you find that the Universe
      sometimes sends you very irrelevant messages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow it to,&rdquo; Mr. Barbecue-Smith replied. &ldquo;I canalise it. I bring
      it down through pipes to work the turbines of my conscious mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Niagara,&rdquo; Denis suggested. Some of Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s remarks
      sounded strangely like quotations&mdash;quotations from his own works, no
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Like Niagara. And this is how I do it.&rdquo; He leaned forward, and
      with a raised forefinger marked his points as he made them, beating time,
      as it were, to his discourse. &ldquo;Before I go off into my trance, I
      concentrate on the subject I wish to be inspired about. Let us say I am
      writing about the humble heroisms; for ten minutes before I go into the
      trance I think of nothing but orphans supporting their little brothers and
      sisters, of dull work well and patiently done, and I focus my mind on such
      great philosophical truths as the purification and uplifting of the soul
      by suffering, and the alchemical transformation of leaden evil into golden
      good.&rdquo; (Denis again hung up his little festoon of quotation marks.) &ldquo;Then
      I pop off. Two or three hours later I wake up again, and find that
      inspiration has done its work. Thousands of words, comforting, uplifting
      words, lie before me. I type them out neatly on my machine and they are
      ready for the printer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all sounds wonderfully simple,&rdquo; said Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. All the great and splendid and divine things of life are
      wonderfully simple.&rdquo; (Quotation marks again.) &ldquo;When I have to do my
      aphorisms,&rdquo; Mr. Barbecue-Smith continued, &ldquo;I prelude my trance by turning
      over the pages of any Dictionary of Quotations or Shakespeare Calendar
      that comes to hand. That sets the key, so to speak; that ensures that the
      Universe shall come flowing in, not in a continuous rush, but in
      aphorismic drops. You see the idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis nodded. Mr. Barbecue-Smith put his hand in his pocket and pulled out
      a notebook. &ldquo;I did a few in the train to-day,&rdquo; he said, turning over the
      pages. &ldquo;Just dropped off into a trance in the corner of my carriage. I
      find the train very conducive to good work. Here they are.&rdquo; He cleared his
      throat and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mountain Road may be steep, but the air is pure up there, and it is
      from the Summit that one gets the view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Things that Really Matter happen in the Heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was curious, Denis reflected, the way the Infinite sometimes repeated
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing is Believing. Yes, but Believing is also Seeing. If I believe in
      God, I see God, even in the things that seem to be evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbecue-Smith looked up from his notebook. &ldquo;That last one,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;is particularly subtle and beautiful, don&rsquo;t you think? Without
      Inspiration I could never have hit on that.&rdquo; He re-read the apophthegm
      with a slower and more solemn utterance. &ldquo;Straight from the Infinite,&rdquo; he
      commented reflectively, then addressed himself to the next aphorism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The flame of a candle gives Light, but it also Burns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Puzzled wrinkles appeared on Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      exactly know what that means,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very gnomic. One could apply
      it, of course to the Higher Education&mdash;illuminating, but provoking
      the Lower Classes to discontent and revolution. Yes, I suppose that&rsquo;s what
      it is. But it&rsquo;s gnomic, it&rsquo;s gnomic.&rdquo; He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. The
      gong sounded again, clamorously, it seemed imploringly: dinner was growing
      cold. It roused Mr. Barbecue-Smith from meditation. He turned to Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand me now when I advise you to cultivate your Inspiration.
      Let your Subconscious work for you; turn on the Niagara of the Infinite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of feet on the stairs. Mr. Barbecue-Smith got up, laid
      his hand for an instant on Denis&rsquo;s shoulder, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more now. Another time. And remember, I rely absolutely on your
      discretion in this matter. There are intimate, sacred things that one
      doesn&rsquo;t wish to be generally known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;I quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t Crome all the
      beds were ancient hereditary pieces of furniture. Huge beds, like
      four-masted ships, with furled sails of shining coloured stuff. Beds
      carved and inlaid, beds painted and gilded. Beds of walnut and oak, of
      rare exotic woods. Beds of every date and fashion from the time of Sir
      Ferdinando, who built the house, to the time of his namesake in the late
      eighteenth century, the last of the family, but all of them grandiose,
      magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finest of all was now Anne&rsquo;s bed. Sir Julius, son to Sir Ferdinando,
      had had it made in Venice against his wife&rsquo;s first lying-in. Early
      seicento Venice had expended all its extravagant art in the making of it.
      The body of the bed was like a great square sarcophagus. Clustering roses
      were carved in high relief on its wooden panels, and luscious putti
      wallowed among the roses. On the black ground-work of the panels the
      carved reliefs were gilded and burnished. The golden roses twined in
      spirals up the four pillar-like posts, and cherubs, seated at the top of
      each column, supported a wooden canopy fretted with the same carved
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was reading in bed. Two candles stood on the little table beside her,
      in their rich light her face, her bare arm and shoulder took on warm hues
      and a sort of peach-like quality of surface. Here and there in the canopy
      above her carved golden petals shone brightly among profound shadows, and
      the soft light, falling on the sculptured panel of the bed, broke
      restlessly among the intricate roses, lingered in a broad caress on the
      blown cheeks, the dimpled bellies, the tight, absurd little posteriors of
      the sprawling putti.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a discreet tap at the door. She looked up. &ldquo;Come in, come in.&rdquo; A
      face, round and childish, within its sleek bell of golden hair, peered
      round the opening door. More childish-looking still, a suit of mauve
      pyjamas made its entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mary. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just look in for a moment to say good-night,&rdquo;
       she said, and sat down on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne closed her book. &ldquo;That was very sweet of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you reading?&rdquo; She looked at the book. &ldquo;Rather second-rate, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo; The tone in which Mary pronounced the word &ldquo;second-rate&rdquo; implied an
      almost infinite denigration. She was accustomed in London to associate
      only with first-rate people who liked first-rate things, and she knew that
      there were very, very few first-rate things in the world, and that those
      were mostly French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid I like it,&rdquo; said Anne. There was nothing more to be
      said. The silence that followed was a rather uncomfortable one. Mary
      fiddled uneasily with the bottom button of her pyjama jacket. Leaning back
      on her mound of heaped-up pillows, Anne waited and wondered what was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so awfully afraid of repressions,&rdquo; said Mary at last, bursting
      suddenly and surprisingly into speech. She pronounced the words on the
      tail-end of an expiring breath, and had to gasp for new air almost before
      the phrase was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to be depressed about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said repressions, not depressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, repressions; I see,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;But repressions of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had to explain. &ldquo;The natural instincts of sex...&rdquo; she began
      didactically. But Anne cut her short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Perfectly. I understand. Repressions! old maids and all the
      rest. But what about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of them. It&rsquo;s always dangerous to
      repress one&rsquo;s instincts. I&rsquo;m beginning to detect in myself symptoms like
      the ones you read of in the books. I constantly dream that I&rsquo;m falling
      down wells; and sometimes I even dream that I&rsquo;m climbing up ladders. It&rsquo;s
      most disquieting. The symptoms are only too clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One may become a nymphomaniac if one&rsquo;s not careful. You&rsquo;ve no idea how
      serious these repressions are if you don&rsquo;t get rid of them in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds too awful,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see that I can do anything
      to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just like to talk it over with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course; I&rsquo;m only too happy, Mary darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary coughed and drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; she began sententiously,
      &ldquo;I presume we may take for granted that an intelligent young woman of
      twenty-three who has lived in civilised society in the twentieth century
      has no prejudices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I confess I still have a few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not about repressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not many about repressions; that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, rather, about getting rid of repressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for our fundamental postulate,&rdquo; said Mary. Solemnity was
      expressed in every feature of her round young face, radiated from her
      large blue eyes. &ldquo;We come next to the desirability of possessing
      experience. I hope we are agreed that knowledge is desirable and that
      ignorance is undesirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obedient as one of those complaisant disciples from whom Socrates could
      get whatever answer he chose, Anne gave her assent to this proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are equally agreed, I hope, that marriage is what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;And repressions being what they are...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would therefore seem to be only one conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I knew that,&rdquo; Anne exclaimed, &ldquo;before you began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but now it&rsquo;s been proved,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;One must do things logically.
      The question is now...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where does the question come in? You&rsquo;ve reached your only possible
      conclusion&mdash;logically, which is more than I could have done. All that
      remains is to impart the information to someone you like&mdash;someone you
      like really rather a lot, someone you&rsquo;re in love with, if I may express
      myself so baldly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just where the question comes in,&rdquo; Mary exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in
      love with anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if I were you, I should wait till you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go on dreaming night after night that I&rsquo;m falling down a
      well. It&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it really is TOO dangerous, then of course you must do something
      about it; you must find somebody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who?&rdquo; A thoughtful frown puckered Mary&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;It must be somebody
      intelligent, somebody with intellectual interests that I can share. And it
      must be somebody with a proper respect for women, somebody who&rsquo;s prepared
      to talk seriously about his work and his ideas and about my work and my
      ideas. It isn&rsquo;t, as you see, at all easy to find the right person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;there are three unattached and intelligent men in the
      house at the present time. There&rsquo;s Mr. Scogan, to begin with; but perhaps
      he&rsquo;s rather too much of a genuine antique. And there are Gombauld and
      Denis. Shall we say that the choice is limited to the last two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded. &ldquo;I think we had better,&rdquo; she said, and then hesitated, with a
      certain air of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; said Mary, with a gasp, &ldquo;whether they really were
      unattached. I thought that perhaps you might...you might...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very nice of you to think of me, Mary darling,&rdquo; said Anne, smiling
      the tight cat&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;But as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they are both
      entirely unattached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad of that,&rdquo; said Mary, looking relieved. &ldquo;We are now
      confronted with the question: Which of the two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give no advice. It&rsquo;s a matter for your taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a matter of my taste,&rdquo; Mary pronounced, &ldquo;but of their merits. We
      must weigh them and consider them carefully and dispassionately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must do the weighing yourself,&rdquo; said Anne; there was still the trace
      of a smile at the corners of her mouth and round the half-closed eyes. &ldquo;I
      won&rsquo;t run the risk of advising you wrongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gombauld has more talent,&rdquo; Mary began, &ldquo;but he is less civilised than
      Denis.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s pronunciation of &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; gave the word a special and
      additional significance. She uttered it meticulously, in the very front of
      her mouth, hissing delicately on the opening sibilant. So few people were
      civilised, and they, like the first-rate works of art, were mostly French.
      &ldquo;Civilisation is most important, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne held up her hand. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t advise,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must make the
      decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gombauld&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; Mary went on reflectively, &ldquo;comes from Marseilles.
      Rather a dangerous heredity, when one thinks of the Latin attitude towards
      women. But then, I sometimes wonder whether Denis is altogether
      serious-minded, whether he isn&rsquo;t rather a dilettante. It&rsquo;s very difficult.
      What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not listening,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I refuse to take any responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary sighed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think I had better go to bed and think
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carefully and dispassionately,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door Mary turned round. &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said, and wondered as she
      said the words why Anne was smiling in that curious way. It was probably
      nothing, she reflected. Anne often smiled for no apparent reason; it was
      probably just a habit. &ldquo;I hope I shan&rsquo;t dream of falling down wells again
      to-night,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladders are worse,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded. &ldquo;Yes, ladders are much graver.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>reakfast on Sunday
      morning was an hour later than on week-days, and Priscilla, who usually
      made no public appearance before luncheon, honoured it by her presence.
      Dressed in black silk, with a ruby cross as well as her customary string
      of pearls round her neck, she presided. An enormous Sunday paper concealed
      all but the extreme pinnacle of her coiffure from the outer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see Surrey has won,&rdquo; she said, with her mouth full, &ldquo;by four wickets.
      The sun is in Leo: that would account for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid game, cricket,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Barbecue-Smith heartily to no one
      in particular; &ldquo;so thoroughly English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny, who was sitting next to him, woke up suddenly with a start. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So English,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Barbecue-Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny looked at him, surprised. &ldquo;English? Of course I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was beginning to explain, when Mrs. Wimbush vailed her Sunday paper,
      and appeared, a square, mauve-powdered face in the midst of orange
      splendours. &ldquo;I see there&rsquo;s a new series of articles on the next world just
      beginning,&rdquo; she said to Mr. Barbecue-Smith. &ldquo;This one&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Summer
      Land and Gehenna.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Summer Land,&rdquo; echoed Mr. Barbecue-Smith, closing his eyes. &ldquo;Summer Land.
      A beautiful name. Beautiful&mdash;beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had taken the seat next to Denis&rsquo;s. After a night of careful
      consideration she had decided on Denis. He might have less talent than
      Gombauld, he might be a little lacking in seriousness, but somehow he was
      safer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you writing much poetry here in the country?&rdquo; she asked, with a
      bright gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Denis curtly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t brought my typewriter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you mean to say you can&rsquo;t write without a typewriter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis shook his head. He hated talking at breakfast, and, besides, he
      wanted to hear what Mr. Scogan was saying at the other end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...My scheme for dealing with the Church,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan was saying, &ldquo;is
      beautifully simple. At the present time the Anglican clergy wear their
      collars the wrong way round. I would compel them to wear, not only their
      collars, but all their clothes, turned back to frantic&mdash;coat,
      waistcoat, trousers, boots&mdash;so that every clergyman should present to
      the world a smooth facade, unbroken by stud, button, or lace. The
      enforcement of such a livery would act as a wholesome deterrent to those
      intending to enter the Church. At the same time it would enormously
      enhance, what Archbishop Laud so rightly insisted on, the &lsquo;beauty of
      holiness&rsquo; in the few incorrigibles who could not be deterred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In hell, it seems,&rdquo; said Priscilla, reading in her Sunday paper, &ldquo;the
      children amuse themselves by flaying lambs alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but, dear lady, that&rsquo;s only a symbol,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Barbecue-Smith,
      &ldquo;a material symbol of a h-piritual truth. Lambs signify...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are military uniforms,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan went on. &ldquo;When scarlet and
      pipe-clay were abandoned for khaki, there were some who trembled for the
      future of war. But then, finding how elegant the new tunic was, how
      closely it clipped the waist, how voluptuously, with the lateral bustles
      of the pockets, it exaggerated the hips; when they realized the brilliant
      potentialities of breeches and top-boots, they were reassured. Abolish
      these military elegances, standardise a uniform of sack-cloth and
      mackintosh, you will very soon find that...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anyone coming to church with me this morning?&rdquo; asked Henry Wimbush. No
      one responded. He baited his bare invitation. &ldquo;I read the lessons, you
      know. And there&rsquo;s Mr. Bodiham. His sermons are sometimes worth hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. &ldquo;I for one prefer to
      worship in the infinite church of Nature. How does our Shakespeare put it?
      &lsquo;Sermons in books, stones in the running brooks.&rsquo;&rdquo; He waved his arm in a
      fine gesture towards the window, and even as he did so he became vaguely,
      but none the less insistently, none the less uncomfortably aware that
      something had gone wrong with the quotation. Something&mdash;what could it
      be? Sermons? Stones? Books?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Bodiham was
      sitting in his study at the Rectory. The nineteenth-century Gothic
      windows, narrow and pointed, admitted the light grudgingly; in spite of
      the brilliant July weather, the room was sombre. Brown varnished
      bookshelves lined the walls, filled with row upon row of those thick,
      heavy theological works which the second-hand booksellers generally sell
      by weight. The mantelpiece, the over-mantel, a towering structure of
      spindly pillars and little shelves, were brown and varnished. The
      writing-desk was brown and varnished. So were the chairs, so was the door.
      A dark red-brown carpet with patterns covered the floor. Everything was
      brown in the room, and there was a curious brownish smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this brown gloom Mr. Bodiham sat at his desk. He was the
      man in the Iron Mask. A grey metallic face with iron cheek-bones and a
      narrow iron brow; iron folds, hard and unchanging, ran perpendicularly
      down his cheeks; his nose was the iron beak of some thin, delicate bird of
      rapine. He had brown eyes, set in sockets rimmed with iron; round them the
      skin was dark, as though it had been charred. Dense wiry hair covered his
      skull; it had been black, it was turning grey. His ears were very small
      and fine. His jaws, his chin, his upper lip were dark, iron-dark, where he
      had shaved. His voice, when he spoke and especially when he raised it in
      preaching, was harsh, like the grating of iron hinges when a seldom-used
      door is opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly half-past twelve. He had just come back from church, hoarse
      and weary with preaching. He preached with fury, with passion, an iron man
      beating with a flail upon the souls of his congregation. But the souls of
      the faithful at Crome were made of india-rubber, solid rubber; the flail
      rebounded. They were used to Mr. Bodiham at Crome. The flail thumped on
      india-rubber, and as often as not the rubber slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning he had preached, as he had often preached before, on the
      nature of God. He had tried to make them understand about God, what a
      fearful thing it was to fall into His hands. God&mdash;they thought of
      something soft and merciful. They blinded themselves to facts; still more,
      they blinded themselves to the Bible. The passengers on the &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo; sang
      &ldquo;Nearer my God to Thee&rdquo; as the ship was going down. Did they realise what
      they were asking to be brought nearer to? A white fire of righteousness,
      an angry fire...
    </p>
    <p>
      When Savonarola preached, men sobbed and groaned aloud. Nothing broke the
      polite silence with which Crome listened to Mr. Bodiham&mdash;only an
      occasional cough and sometimes the sound of heavy breathing. In the front
      pew sat Henry Wimbush, calm, well-bred, beautifully dressed. There were
      times when Mr. Bodiham wanted to jump down from the pulpit and shake him
      into life,&mdash;times when he would have liked to beat and kill his whole
      congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at his desk dejectedly. Outside the Gothic windows the earth was
      warm and marvellously calm. Everything was as it had always been. And yet,
      and yet...It was nearly four years now since he had preached that sermon
      on Matthew xxiv. 7: &ldquo;For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom
      against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
      earthquakes, in divers places.&rdquo; It was nearly four years. He had had the
      sermon printed; it was so terribly, so vitally important that all the
      world should know what he had to say. A copy of the little pamphlet lay on
      his desk&mdash;eight small grey pages, printed by a fount of type that had
      grown blunt, like an old dog&rsquo;s teeth, by the endless champing and champing
      of the press. He opened it and began to read it yet once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
      and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers
      places.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen centuries have elapsed since Our Lord gave utterance to those
      words, and not a single one of them has been without wars, plagues,
      famines, and earthquakes. Mighty empires have crashed in ruin to the
      ground, diseases have unpeopled half the globe, there have been vast
      natural cataclysms in which thousands have been overwhelmed by flood and
      fire and whirlwind. Time and again, in the course of these nineteen
      centuries, such things have happened, but they have not brought Christ
      back to earth. They were &lsquo;signs of the times&rsquo; inasmuch as they were signs
      of God&rsquo;s wrath against the chronic wickedness of mankind, but they were
      not signs of the times in connection with the Second Coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If earnest Christians have regarded the present war as a true sign of the
      Lord&rsquo;s approaching return, it is not merely because it happens to be a
      great war involving the lives of millions of people, not merely because
      famine is tightening its grip on every country in Europe, not merely
      because disease of every kind, from syphilis to spotted fever, is rife
      among the warring nations; no, it is not for these reasons that we regard
      this war as a true Sign of the Times, but because in its origin and its
      progress it is marked by certain characteristics which seem to connect it
      almost beyond a doubt with the predictions in Christian Prophecy relating
      to the Second Coming of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me enumerate the features of the present war which most clearly
      suggest that it is a Sign foretelling the near approach of the Second
      Advent. Our Lord said that &lsquo;this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached
      in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
      come.&rsquo; Although it would be presumptuous for us to say what degree of
      evangelisation will be regarded by God as sufficient, we may at least
      confidently hope that a century of unflagging missionary work has brought
      the fulfilment of this condition at any rate near. True, the larger number
      of the world&rsquo;s inhabitants have remained deaf to the preaching of the true
      religion; but that does not vitiate the fact that the Gospel HAS been
      preached &lsquo;for a witness&rsquo; to all unbelievers from the Papist to the Zulu.
      The responsibility for the continued prevalence of unbelief lies, not with
      the preachers, but with those preached to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, it has been generally recognised that &lsquo;the drying up of the waters
      of the great river Euphrates,&rsquo; mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of
      Revelation, refers to the decay and extinction of Turkish power, and is a
      sign of the near approaching end of the world as we know it. The capture
      of Jerusalem and the successes in Mesopotamia are great strides forward in
      the destruction of the Ottoman Empire; though it must be admitted that the
      Gallipoli episode proved that the Turk still possesses a &lsquo;notable horn&rsquo; of
      strength. Historically speaking, this drying up of Ottoman power has been
      going on for the past century; the last two years have witnessed a great
      acceleration of the process, and there can be no doubt that complete
      desiccation is within sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Closely following on the words concerning the drying up of Euphrates
      comes the prophecy of Armageddon, that world war with which the Second
      Coming is to be so closely associated. Once begun, the world war can end
      only with the return of Christ, and His coming will be sudden and
      unexpected, like that of a thief in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us examine the facts. In history, exactly as in St. John&rsquo;s Gospel,
      the world war is immediately preceded by the drying up of Euphrates, or
      the decay of Turkish power. This fact alone would be enough to connect the
      present conflict with the Armageddon of Revelation and therefore to point
      to the near approach of the Second Advent. But further evidence of an even
      more solid and convincing nature can be adduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armageddon is brought about by the activities of three unclean spirits,
      as it were toads, which come out of the mouths of the Dragon, the Beast,
      and the False Prophet. If we can identify these three powers of evil much
      light will clearly be thrown on the whole question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet can all be identified in
      history. Satan, who can only work through human agency, has used these
      three powers in the long war against Christ which has filled the last
      nineteen centuries with religious strife. The Dragon, it has been
      sufficiently established, is pagan Rome, and the spirit issuing from its
      mouth is the spirit of Infidelity. The Beast, alternatively symbolised as
      a Woman, is undoubtedly the Papal power, and Popery is the spirit which it
      spews forth. There is only one power which answers to the description of
      the False Prophet, the wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, the agent of the devil
      working in the guise of the Lamb, and that power is the so-called &lsquo;Society
      of Jesus.&rsquo; The spirit that issues from the mouth of the False Prophet is
      the spirit of False Morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may assume, then, that the three evil spirits are Infidelity, Popery,
      and False Morality. Have these three influences been the real cause of the
      present conflict? The answer is clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit of Infidelity is the very spirit of German criticism. The
      Higher Criticism, as it is mockingly called, denies the possibility of
      miracles, prediction, and real inspiration, and attempts to account for
      the Bible as a natural development. Slowly but surely, during the last
      eighty years, the spirit of Infidelity has been robbing the Germans of
      their Bible and their faith, so that Germany is to-day a nation of
      unbelievers. Higher Criticism has thus made the war possible; for it would
      be absolutely impossible for any Christian nation to wage war as Germany
      is waging it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We come next to the spirit of Popery, whose influence in causing the war
      was quite as great as that of Infidelity, though not, perhaps, so
      immediately obvious. Since the Franco-Prussian War the Papal power has
      steadily declined in France, while in Germany it has steadily increased.
      To-day France is an anti-papal state, while Germany possesses a powerful
      Roman Catholic minority. Two papally controlled states, Germany and
      Austria, are at war with six anti-papal states&mdash;England, France,
      Italy, Russia, Serbia, and Portugal. Belgium is, of course, a thoroughly
      papal state, and there can be little doubt that the presence on the
      Allies&rsquo; side of an element so essentially hostile has done much to hamper
      the righteous cause and is responsible for our comparative ill-success.
      That the spirit of Popery is behind the war is thus seen clearly enough in
      the grouping of the opposed powers, while the rebellion in the Roman
      Catholic parts of Ireland has merely confirmed a conclusion already
      obvious to any unbiased mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit of False Morality has played as great a part in this war as
      the two other evil spirits. The Scrap of Paper incident is the nearest and
      most obvious example of Germany&rsquo;s adherence to this essentially
      unchristian or Jesuitical morality. The end is German world-power, and in
      the attainment of this end, any means are justifiable. It is the true
      principle of Jesuitry applied to international politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The identification is now complete. As was predicted in Revelation, the
      three evil spirits have gone forth just as the decay of the Ottoman power
      was nearing completion, and have joined together to make the world war.
      The warning, &lsquo;Behold, I come as a thief,&rsquo; is therefore meant for the
      present period&mdash;for you and me and all the world. This war will lead
      on inevitably to the war of Armageddon, and will only be brought to an end
      by the Lord&rsquo;s personal return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when He returns, what will happen? Those who are in Christ, St. John
      tells us, will be called to the Supper of the Lamb. Those who are found
      fighting against Him will be called to the Supper of the Great God&mdash;that
      grim banquet where they shall not feast, but be feasted on. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; as St.
      John says, &lsquo;I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried in a loud
      voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and
      gather yourselves together unto the supper of the Great God; that ye may
      eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty
      men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh
      of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.&rsquo; All the enemies of
      Christ will be slain with the sword of him that sits upon the horse, &lsquo;and
      all the fowls will be filled with their flesh.&rsquo; That is the Supper of the
      Great God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be soon or it may, as men reckon time, be long; but sooner or
      later, inevitably, the Lord will come and deliver the world from its
      present troubles. And woe unto them who are called, not to the Supper of
      the Lamb, but to the Supper of the Great God. They will realise then, but
      too late, that God is a God of Wrath as well as a God of Forgiveness. The
      God who sent bears to devour the mockers of Elisha, the God who smote the
      Egyptians for their stubborn wickedness, will assuredly smite them too,
      unless they make haste to repent. But perhaps it is already too late. Who
      knows but that to-morrow, in a moment even, Christ may be upon us
      unawares, like a thief? In a little while, who knows? The angel standing
      in the sun may be summoning the ravens and vultures from their crannies in
      the rocks to feed upon the putrefying flesh of the millions of unrighteous
      whom God&rsquo;s wrath has destroyed. Be ready, then; the coming of the Lord is
      at hand. May it be for all of you an object of hope, not a moment to look
      forward to with terror and trembling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bodiham closed the little pamphlet and leaned back in his chair. The
      argument was sound, absolutely compelling; and yet&mdash;it was four years
      since he had preached that sermon; four years, and England was at peace,
      the sun shone, the people of Crome were as wicked and indifferent as ever&mdash;more
      so, indeed, if that were possible. If only he could understand, if the
      heavens would but make a sign! But his questionings remained unanswered.
      Seated there in his brown varnished chair under the Ruskinian window, he
      could have screamed aloud. He gripped the arms of his chair&mdash;gripping,
      gripping for control. The knuckles of his hands whitened; he bit his lip.
      In a few seconds he was able to relax the tension; he began to rebuke
      himself for his rebellious impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four years, he reflected; what were four years, after all? It must
      inevitably take a long time for Armageddon to ripen to yeast itself up.
      The episode of 1914 had been a preliminary skirmish. And as for the war
      having come to an end&mdash;why, that, of course, was illusory. It was
      still going on, smouldering away in Silesia, in Ireland, in Anatolia; the
      discontent in Egypt and India was preparing the way, perhaps, for a great
      extension of the slaughter among the heathen peoples. The Chinese boycott
      of Japan, and the rivalries of that country and America in the Pacific,
      might be breeding a great new war in the East. The prospect, Mr. Bodiham
      tried to assure himself, was hopeful; the real, the genuine Armageddon
      might soon begin, and then, like a thief in the night...But, in spite of
      all his comfortable reasoning, he remained unhappy, dissatisfied. Four
      years ago he had been so confident; God&rsquo;s intention seemed then so plain.
      And now? Now, he did well to be angry. And now he suffered too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden and silent as a phantom Mrs. Bodiham appeared, gliding noiselessly
      across the room. Above her black dress her face was pale with an opaque
      whiteness, her eyes were pale as water in a glass, and her strawy hair was
      almost colourless. She held a large envelope in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This came for you by the post,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope was unsealed. Mechanically Mr. Bodiham tore it open. It
      contained a pamphlet, larger than his own and more elegant in appearance.
      &ldquo;The House of Sheeny, Clerical Outfitters, Birmingham.&rdquo; He turned over the
      pages. The catalogue was tastefully and ecclesiastically printed in
      antique characters with illuminated Gothic initials. Red marginal lines,
      crossed at the corners after the manner of an Oxford picture frame,
      enclosed each page of type, little red crosses took the place of full
      stops. Mr. Bodiham turned the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soutane in best black merino. Ready to wear; in all sizes. Clerical frock
      coats. From nine guineas. A dressy garment, tailored by our own
      experienced ecclesiastical cutters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-tone illustrations represented young curates, some dapper, some
      Rugbeian and muscular, some with ascetic faces and large ecstatic eyes,
      dressed in jackets, in frock-coats, in surplices, in clerical evening
      dress, in black Norfolk suitings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A large assortment of chasubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rope girdles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheeny&rsquo;s Special Skirt Cassocks. Tied by a string about the waist...When
      worn under a surplice presents an appearance indistinguishable from that
      of a complete cassock...Recommended for summer wear and hot climates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of horror and disgust Mr. Bodiham threw the catalogue into
      the waste-paper basket. Mrs. Bodiham looked at him; her pale, glaucous
      eyes reflected his action without comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The village,&rdquo; she said in her quiet voice, &ldquo;the village grows worse and
      worse every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened now?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bodiham, feeling suddenly very weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; She pulled up a brown varnished chair and sat down. In
      the village of Crome, it seemed, Sodom and Gomorrah had come to a second
      birth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>enis did not
      dance, but when ragtime came squirting out of the pianola in gushes of
      treacle and hot perfume, in jets of Bengal light, then things began to
      dance inside him. Little black nigger corpuscles jigged and drummed in his
      arteries. He became a cage of movement, a walking palais de danse. It was
      very uncomfortable, like the preliminary symptoms of a disease. He sat in
      one of the window-seats, glumly pretending to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the pianola, Henry Wimbush, smoking a long cigar through a tunnelled
      pillar of amber, trod out the shattering dance music with serene patience.
      Locked together, Gombauld and Anne moved with a harmoniousness that made
      them seem a single creature, two-headed and four-legged. Mr. Scogan,
      solemnly buffoonish, shuffled round the room with Mary. Jenny sat in the
      shadow behind the piano, scribbling, so it seemed, in a big red notebook.
      In arm-chairs by the fireplace, Priscilla and Mr. Barbecue-Smith discussed
      higher things, without, apparently, being disturbed by the noise on the
      Lower Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Optimism,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbecue-Smith with a tone of finality, speaking
      through strains of the &ldquo;Wild, Wild Women&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;optimism is the opening
      out of the soul towards the light; it is an expansion towards and into
      God, it is a h-piritual self-unification with the Infinite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How true!&rdquo; sighed Priscilla, nodding the baleful splendours of her
      coiffure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pessimism, on the other hand, is the contraction of the soul towards
      darkness; it is a focusing of the self upon a point in the Lower Plane; it
      is a h-piritual slavery to mere facts; to gross physical phenomena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re making a wild man of me.&rdquo; The refrain sang itself over in Denis&rsquo;s
      mind. Yes, they were; damn them! A wild man, but not wild enough; that was
      the trouble. Wild inside; raging, writhing&mdash;yes, &ldquo;writhing&rdquo; was the
      word, writhing with desire. But outwardly he was hopelessly tame;
      outwardly&mdash;baa, baa, baa.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were, Anne and Gombauld, moving together as though they were a
      single supple creature. The beast with two backs. And he sat in a corner,
      pretending to read, pretending he didn&rsquo;t want to dance, pretending he
      rather despised dancing. Why? It was the baa-baa business again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was he born with a different face? Why WAS he? Gombauld had a face of
      brass&mdash;one of those old, brazen rams that thumped against the walls
      of cities till they fell. He was born with a different face&mdash;a woolly
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music stopped. The single harmonious creature broke in two. Flushed, a
      little breathless, Anne swayed across the room to the pianola, laid her
      hand on Mr. Wimbush&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A waltz this time, please, Uncle Henry,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A waltz,&rdquo; he repeated, and turned to the cabinet where the rolls were
      kept. He trod off the old roll and trod on the new, a slave at the mill,
      uncomplaining and beautifully well bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Rum; Tum; Rum-ti-ti; Tum-ti-ti...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The melody wallowed oozily along, like a ship moving forward over a sleek
      and oily swell. The four-legged creature, more graceful, more harmonious
      in its movements than ever, slid across the floor. Oh, why was he born
      with a different face?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you reading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, startled. It was Mary. She had broken from the uncomfortable
      embrace of Mr. Scogan, who had now seized on Jenny for his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you reading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Denis truthfully. He looked at the title page; the
      book was called &ldquo;The Stock Breeder&rsquo;s Vade Mecum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are so sensible to sit and read quietly,&rdquo; said Mary, fixing
      him with her china eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why one dances. It&rsquo;s so boring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis made no reply; she exacerbated him. From the arm-chair by the
      fireplace he heard Priscilla&rsquo;s deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Mr Barbecue-Smith&mdash;you know all about science, I know&mdash;&rdquo;
       A deprecating noise came from Mr. Barbecue-Smith&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;This Einstein
      theory. It seems to upset the whole starry universe. It makes me so
      worried about my horoscopes. You see...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary renewed her attack. &ldquo;Which of the contemporary poets do you like
      best?&rdquo; she asked. Denis was filled with fury. Why couldn&rsquo;t this pest of a
      girl leave him alone? He wanted to listen to the horrible music, to watch
      them dancing&mdash;oh, with what grace, as though they had been made for
      one another!&mdash;to savour his misery in peace. And she came and put him
      through this absurd catechism! She was like &ldquo;Mangold&rsquo;s Questions&rdquo;: &ldquo;What
      are the three diseases of wheat?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Which of the contemporary poets
      do you like best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blight, Mildew, and Smut,&rdquo; he replied, with the laconism of one who is
      absolutely certain of his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several hours before Denis managed to go to sleep that night. Vague
      but agonising miseries possessed his mind. It was not only Anne who made
      him miserable; he was wretched about himself, the future, life in general,
      the universe. &ldquo;This adolescence business,&rdquo; he repeated to himself every
      now and then, &ldquo;is horribly boring.&rdquo; But the fact that he knew his disease
      did not help him to cure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After kicking all the clothes off the bed, he got up and sought relief in
      composition. He wanted to imprison his nameless misery in words. At the
      end of an hour, nine more or less complete lines emerged from among the
      blots and scratchings.
    </p>
    <p>

      asleep.

      was gone. The motor had whirled him away to the station; a faint smell of
      burning oil commemorated his recent departure. A considerable detachment
      had come into the courtyard to speed him on his way; and now they were
      walking back, round the side of the house, towards the terrace and the
      garden. They walked in silence; nobody had yet ventured to comment on the
      departed guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Anne at last, turning with raised inquiring eyebrows to
      Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; It was time for someone to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis declined the invitation; he passed it on to Mr Scogan. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan did not respond; he only repeated the question, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;

    <p>
      It was left for Henry Wimbush to make a pronouncement. &ldquo;A very agreeable
      adjunct to the week-end,&rdquo; he said. His tone was obituary.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had descended, without paying much attention where they were going,
      the steep yew-walk that went down, under the flank of the terrace, to the
      pool. The house towered above them, immensely tall, with the whole height
      of the built-up terrace added to its own seventy feet of brick façade. The
      perpendicular lines of the three towers soared up, uninterrupted,
      enhancing the impression of height until it became overwhelming. They
      paused at the edge of the pool to look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who built this house knew his business,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;He was an
      architect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush reflectively. &ldquo;I doubt it. The builder of
      this house was Sir Ferdinando Lapith, who flourished during the reign of
      Elizabeth. He inherited the estate from his father, to whom it had been
      granted at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries; for Crome was
      originally a cloister of monks and this swimming-pool their fish-pond. Sir
      Ferdinando was not content merely to adapt the old monastic buildings to
      his own purposes; but using them as a stone quarry for his barns and byres
      and outhouses, he built for himself a grand new house of brick&mdash;the
      house you see now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand in the direction of the house and was silent, severe,
      imposing, almost menacing, Crome loomed down on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great thing about Crome,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, seizing the opportunity to
      speak, &ldquo;is the fact that it&rsquo;s so unmistakably and aggressively a work of
      art. It makes no compromise with nature, but affronts it and rebels
      against it. It has no likeness to Shelley&rsquo;s tower, in the &lsquo;Epipsychidion,&rsquo; 
      which, if I remember rightly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Seems not now a work of human art,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But as it were titanic, in the heart
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of earth having assumed its form and grown
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Out of the mountain, from the living stone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Lifting itself in caverns light and high.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, there isn&rsquo;t any nonsense of that sort about Crome. That the
      hovels of the peasantry should look as though they had grown out of the
      earth, to which their inmates are attached, is right, no doubt, and
      suitable. But the house of an intelligent, civilised, and sophisticated
      man should never seem to have sprouted from the clods. It should rather be
      an expression of his grand unnatural remoteness from the cloddish life.
      Since the days of William Morris that&rsquo;s a fact which we in England have
      been unable to comprehend. Civilised and sophisticated men have solemnly
      played at being peasants. Hence quaintness, arts and crafts, cottage
      architecture, and all the rest of it. In the suburbs of our cities you may
      see, reduplicated in endless rows, studiedly quaint imitations and
      adaptations of the village hovel. Poverty, ignorance, and a limited range
      of materials produced the hovel, which possesses undoubtedly, in suitable
      surroundings, its own &lsquo;as it were titanic&rsquo; charm. We now employ our
      wealth, our technical knowledge, our rich variety of materials for the
      purpose of building millions of imitation hovels in totally unsuitable
      surroundings. Could imbecility go further?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Wimbush took up the thread of his interrupted discourse. &ldquo;All that
      you say, my dear Scogan,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;is certainly very just, very true.
      But whether Sir Ferdinando shared your views about architecture or if,
      indeed, he had any views about architecture at all, I very much doubt. In
      building this house, Sir Ferdinando was, as a matter of fact, preoccupied
      by only one thought&mdash;the proper placing of his privies. Sanitation
      was the one great interest of his life. In 1573 he even published, on this
      subject, a little book&mdash;now extremely scarce&mdash;called, &lsquo;Certaine
      Priuy Counsels&rsquo; by &lsquo;One of Her Maiestie&rsquo;s Most Honourable Priuy Counsels,
      F.L. Knight&rsquo;, in which the whole matter is treated with great learning and
      elegance. His guiding principle in arranging the sanitation of a house was
      to secure that the greatest possible distance should separate the privy
      from the sewage arrangements. Hence it followed inevitably that the
      privies were to be placed at the top of the house, being connected by
      vertical shafts with pits or channels in the ground. It must not be
      thought that Sir Ferdinando was moved only by material and merely sanitary
      considerations; for the placing of his privies in an exalted position he
      had also certain excellent spiritual reasons. For, he argues in the third
      chapter of his &lsquo;Priuy Counsels&rsquo;, the necessities of nature are so base and
      brutish that in obeying them we are apt to forget that we are the noblest
      creatures of the universe. To counteract these degrading effects he
      advised that the privy should be in every house the room nearest to
      heaven, that it should be well provided with windows commanding an
      extensive and noble prospect, and that the walls of the chamber should be
      lined with bookshelves containing all the ripest products of human wisdom,
      such as the Proverbs of Solomon, Boethius&rsquo;s &lsquo;Consolations of Philosophy&rsquo;,
      the apophthegms of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, the &lsquo;Enchiridion&rsquo; of
      Erasmus, and all other works, ancient or modern, which testify to the
      nobility of the human soul. In Crome he was able to put his theories into
      practice. At the top of each of the three projecting towers he placed a
      privy. From these a shaft went down the whole height of the house, that is
      to say, more than seventy feet, through the cellars, and into a series of
      conduits provided with flowing water tunnelled in the ground on a level
      with the base of the raised terrace. These conduits emptied themselves
      into the stream several hundred yards below the fish-pond. The total depth
      of the shafts from the top of the towers to their subterranean conduits
      was a hundred and two feet. The eighteenth century, with its passion for
      modernisation, swept away these monuments of sanitary ingenuity. Were it
      not for tradition and the explicit account of them left by Sir Ferdinando,
      we should be unaware that these noble privies had ever existed. We should
      even suppose that Sir Ferdinando built his house after this strange and
      splendid model for merely aesthetic reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The contemplation of the glories of the past always evoked in Henry
      Wimbush a certain enthusiasm. Under the grey bowler his face worked and
      glowed as he spoke. The thought of these vanished privies moved him
      profoundly. He ceased to speak; the light gradually died out of his face,
      and it became once more the replica of the grave, polite hat which shaded
      it. There was a long silence; the same gently melancholy thoughts seemed
      to possess the mind of each of them. Permanence, transience&mdash;Sir
      Ferdinando and his privies were gone, Crome still stood. How brightly the
      sun shone and how inevitable was death! The ways of God were strange; the
      ways of man were stranger still...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does one&rsquo;s heart good,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Scogan at last, &ldquo;to hear of
      these fantastic English aristocrats. To have a theory about privies and to
      build an immense and splendid house in order to put it into practise&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      magnificent, beautiful! I like to think of them all: the eccentric milords
      rolling across Europe in ponderous carriages, bound on extraordinary
      errands. One is going to Venice to buy La Bianchi&rsquo;s larynx; he won&rsquo;t get
      it till she&rsquo;s dead, of course, but no matter; he&rsquo;s prepared to wait; he
      has a collection, pickled in glass bottles, of the throats of famous opera
      singers. And the instruments of renowned virtuosi&mdash;he goes in for
      them too; he will try to bribe Paganini to part with his little Guarnerio,
      but he has small hope of success. Paganini won&rsquo;t sell his fiddle; but
      perhaps he might sacrifice one of his guitars. Others are bound on
      crusades&mdash;one to die miserably among the savage Greeks, another, in
      his white top hat, to lead Italians against their oppressors. Others have
      no business at all; they are just giving their oddity a continental
      airing. At home they cultivate themselves at leisure and with greater
      elaboration. Beckford builds towers, Portland digs holes in the ground,
      Cavendish, the millionaire, lives in a stable, eats nothing but mutton,
      and amuses himself&mdash;oh, solely for his private delectation&mdash;by
      anticipating the electrical discoveries of half a century. Glorious
      eccentrics! Every age is enlivened by their presence. Some day, my dear
      Denis,&rdquo; said Mr Scogan, turning a beady bright regard in his direction&mdash;&ldquo;some
      day you must become their biographer&mdash;&lsquo;The Lives of Queer Men.&rsquo; What
      a subject! I should like to undertake it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan paused, looked up once more at the towering house, then
      murmured the word &ldquo;Eccentricity,&rdquo; two or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eccentricity...It&rsquo;s the justification of all aristocracies. It justifies
      leisured classes and inherited wealth and privilege and endowments and all
      the other injustices of that sort. If you&rsquo;re to do anything reasonable in
      this world, you must have a class of people who are secure, safe from
      public opinion, safe from poverty, leisured, not compelled to waste their
      time in the imbecile routines that go by the name of Honest Work. You must
      have a class of which the members can think and, within the obvious
      limits, do what they please. You must have a class in which people who
      have eccentricities can indulge them and in which eccentricity in general
      will be tolerated and understood. That&rsquo;s the important thing about an
      aristocracy. Not only is it eccentric itself&mdash;often grandiosely so;
      it also tolerates and even encourages eccentricity in others. The
      eccentricities of the artist and the new-fangled thinker don&rsquo;t inspire it
      with that fear, loathing, and disgust which the burgesses instinctively
      feel towards them. It is a sort of Red Indian Reservation planted in the
      midst of a vast horde of Poor Whites&mdash;colonials at that. Within its
      boundaries wild men disport themselves&mdash;often, it must be admitted, a
      little grossly, a little too flamboyantly; and when kindred spirits are
      born outside the pale it offers them some sort of refuge from the hatred
      which the Poor Whites, en bons bourgeois, lavish on anything that is wild
      or out of the ordinary. After the social revolution there will be no
      Reservations; the Redskins will be drowned in the great sea of Poor
      Whites. What then? Will they suffer you to go on writing villanelles, my
      good Denis? Will you, unhappy Henry, be allowed to live in this house of
      the splendid privies, to continue your quiet delving in the mines of
      futile knowledge? Will Anne...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said Anne, interrupting him, &ldquo;will you be allowed to go on
      talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may rest assured,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan replied, &ldquo;that I shall not. I shall
      have some Honest Work to do.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>light, Mildew, and
      Smut...&rdquo; Mary was puzzled and distressed. Perhaps her ears had played her
      false. Perhaps what he had really said was, &ldquo;Squire, Binyon, and Shanks,&rdquo;
       or &ldquo;Childe, Blunden, and Earp,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Abercrombie, Drinkwater, and
      Rabindranath Tagore.&rdquo; Perhaps. But then her ears never did play her false.
      &ldquo;Blight, Mildew, and Smut.&rdquo; The impression was distinct and ineffaceable.
      &ldquo;Blight, Mildew...&rdquo; she was forced to the conclusion, reluctantly, that
      Denis had indeed pronounced those improbable words. He had deliberately
      repelled her attempts to open a serious discussion. That was horrible. A
      man who would not talk seriously to a woman just because she was a woman&mdash;oh,
      impossible! Egeria or nothing. Perhaps Gombauld would be more
      satisfactory. True, his meridional heredity was a little disquieting; but
      at least he was a serious worker, and it was with his work that she would
      associate herself. And Denis? After all, what WAS Denis? A dilettante, an
      amateur...
    </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld had annexed for his painting-room a little disused granary that
      stood by itself in a green close beyond the farm-yard. It was a square
      brick building with a peaked roof and little windows set high up in each
      of its walls. A ladder of four rungs led up to the door; for the granary
      was perched above the ground, and out of reach of the rats, on four
      massive toadstools of grey stone. Within, there lingered a faint smell of
      dust and cobwebs; and the narrow shaft of sunlight that came slanting in
      at every hour of the day through one of the little windows was always
      alive with silvery motes. Here Gombauld worked, with a kind of
      concentrated ferocity, during six or seven hours of each day. He was
      pursuing something new, something terrific, if only he could catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last eight years, nearly half of which had been spent in the
      process of winning the war, he had worked his way industriously through
      cubism. Now he had come out on the other side. He had begun by painting a
      formalised nature; then, little by little, he had risen from nature into
      the world of pure form, till in the end he was painting nothing but his
      own thoughts, externalised in the abstract geometrical forms of the mind&rsquo;s
      devising. He found the process arduous and exhilarating. And then, quite
      suddenly, he grew dissatisfied; he felt himself cramped and confined
      within intolerably narrow limitations. He was humiliated to find how few
      and crude and uninteresting were the forms he could invent; the inventions
      of nature were without number, inconceivably subtle and elaborate. He had
      done with cubism. He was out on the other side. But the cubist discipline
      preserved him from falling into excesses of nature worship. He took from
      nature its rich, subtle, elaborate forms, but his aim was always to work
      them into a whole that should have the thrilling simplicity and formality
      of an idea; to combine prodigious realism with prodigious simplification.
      Memories of Caravaggio&rsquo;s portentous achievements haunted him. Forms of a
      breathing, living reality emerged from darkness, built themselves up into
      compositions as luminously simple and single as a mathematical idea. He
      thought of the &ldquo;Call of Matthew,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Peter Crucified,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Lute
      players,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Magdalen.&rdquo; He had the secret, that astonishing ruffian, he
      had the secret! And now Gombauld was after it, in hot pursuit. Yes, it
      would be something terrific, if only he could catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time an idea had been stirring and spreading, yeastily, in his
      mind. He had made a portfolio full of studies, he had drawn a cartoon; and
      now the idea was taking shape on canvas. A man fallen from a horse. The
      huge animal, a gaunt white cart-horse, filled the upper half of the
      picture with its great body. Its head, lowered towards the ground, was in
      shadow; the immense bony body was what arrested the eye, the body and the
      legs, which came down on either side of the picture like the pillars of an
      arch. On the ground, between the legs of the towering beast, lay the
      foreshortened figure of a man, the head in the extreme foreground, the
      arms flung wide to right and left. A white, relentless light poured down
      from a point in the right foreground. The beast, the fallen man, were
      sharply illuminated; round them, beyond and behind them, was the night.
      They were alone in the darkness, a universe in themselves. The horse&rsquo;s
      body filled the upper part of the picture; the legs, the great hoofs,
      frozen to stillness in the midst of their trampling, limited it on either
      side. And beneath lay the man, his foreshortened face at the focal point
      in the centre, his arms outstretched towards the sides of the picture.
      Under the arch of the horse&rsquo;s belly, between his legs, the eye looked
      through into an intense darkness; below, the space was closed in by the
      figure of the prostrate man. A central gulf of darkness surrounded by
      luminous forms...
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture was more than half finished. Gombauld had been at work all the
      morning on the figure of the man, and now he was taking a rest&mdash;the
      time to smoke a cigarette. Tilting back his chair till it touched the
      wall, he looked thoughtfully at his canvas. He was pleased, and at the
      same time he was desolated. In itself, the thing was good; he knew it. But
      that something he was after, that something that would be so terrific if
      only he could catch it&mdash;had he caught it? Would he ever catch it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Three little taps&mdash;rat, tat, tat! Surprised, Gombauld turned his eyes
      towards the door. Nobody ever disturbed him while he was at work; it was
      one of the unwritten laws. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he called. The door, which was ajar,
      swung open, revealing, from the waist upwards, the form of Mary. She had
      only dared to mount half-way up the ladder. If he didn&rsquo;t want her, retreat
      would be easier and more dignified than if she climbed to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She skipped up the remaining two rungs and was over the threshold in an
      instant. &ldquo;A letter came for you by the second post,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought
      it might be important, so I brought it out to you.&rdquo; Her eyes, her childish
      face were luminously candid as she handed him the letter. There had never
      been a flimsier pretext.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld looked at the envelope and put it in his pocket unopened.
      &ldquo;Luckily,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t at all important. Thanks very much all the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence; Mary felt a little uncomfortable. &ldquo;May I have a look
      at what you&rsquo;ve been painting?&rdquo; she had the courage to say at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld had only half smoked his cigarette; in any case he wouldn&rsquo;t begin
      work again till he had finished. He would give her the five minutes that
      separated him from the bitter end. &ldquo;This is the best place to see it
      from,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked at the picture for some time without saying anything. Indeed,
      she didn&rsquo;t know what to say; she was taken aback, she was at a loss. She
      had expected a cubist masterpiece, and here was a picture of a man and a
      horse, not only recognisable as such, but even aggressively in drawing.
      Trompe-l&rsquo;oeil&mdash;there was no other word to describe the delineation of
      that foreshortened figure under the trampling feet of the horse. What was
      she to think, what was she to say? Her orientations were gone. One could
      admire representationalism in the Old Masters. Obviously. But in a
      modern...? At eighteen she might have done so. But now, after five years
      of schooling among the best judges, her instinctive reaction to a
      contemporary piece of representation was contempt&mdash;an outburst of
      laughing disparagement. What could Gombauld be up to? She had felt so safe
      in admiring his work before. But now&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t know what to think.
      It was very difficult, very difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s rather a lot of chiaroscuro, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; she ventured at last,
      and inwardly congratulated herself on having found a critical formula so
      gentle and at the same time so penetrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Gombauld agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was pleased; he accepted her criticism; it was a serious discussion.
      She put her head on one side and screwed up her eyes. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
      awfully fine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But of course it&rsquo;s a little
      too...too...trompe-l&rsquo;oeil for my taste.&rdquo; She looked at Gombauld, who made
      no response, but continued to smoke, gazing meditatively all the time at
      his picture. Mary went on gaspingly. &ldquo;When I was in Paris this spring I
      saw a lot of Tschuplitski. I admire his work so tremendously. Of course,
      it&rsquo;s frightfully abstract now&mdash;frightfully abstract and frightfully
      intellectual. He just throws a few oblongs on to his canvas&mdash;quite
      flat, you know, and painted in pure primary colours. But his design is
      wonderful. He&rsquo;s getting more and more abstract every day. He&rsquo;d given up
      the third dimension when I was there and was just thinking of giving up
      the second. Soon, he says, there&rsquo;ll be just the blank canvas. That&rsquo;s the
      logical conclusion. Complete abstraction. Painting&rsquo;s finished; he&rsquo;s
      finishing it. When he&rsquo;s reached pure abstraction he&rsquo;s going to take up
      architecture. He says it&rsquo;s more intellectual than painting. Do you agree?&rdquo;
       she asked, with a final gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld dropped his cigarette end and trod on it. &ldquo;Tschuplitski&rsquo;s
      finished painting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finished my cigarette. But I&rsquo;m going on
      painting.&rdquo; And, advancing towards her, he put his arm round her shoulders
      and turned her round, away from the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked up at him; her hair swung back, a soundless bell of gold. Her
      eyes were serene; she smiled. So the moment had come. His arm was round
      her. He moved slowly, almost imperceptibly, and she moved with him. It was
      a peripatetic embracement. &ldquo;Do you agree with him?&rdquo; she repeated. The
      moment might have come, but she would not cease to be intellectual,
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I shall have to think about it.&rdquo; Gombauld loosened his
      embrace, his hand dropped from her shoulder. &ldquo;Be careful going down the
      ladder,&rdquo; he added solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked round, startled. They were in front of the open door. She
      remained standing there for a moment in bewilderment. The hand that had
      rested on her shoulder made itself felt lower down her back; it
      administered three or four kindly little smacks. Replying automatically to
      its stimulus, she moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful going down the ladder,&rdquo; said Gombauld once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was careful. The door closed behind her and she was alone in the
      little green close. She walked slowly back through the farmyard; she was
      pensive.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>enry Wimbush
      brought down with him to dinner a budget of printed sheets loosely bound
      together in a cardboard portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; he said, exhibiting it with a certain solemnity, &ldquo;to-day I have
      finished the printing of my &lsquo;History of Crome&rsquo;. I helped to set up the
      type of the last page this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The famous History?&rdquo; cried Anne. The writing and the printing of this
      Magnum Opus had been going on as long as she could remember. All her
      childhood long Uncle Henry&rsquo;s History had been a vague and fabulous thing,
      often heard of and never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has taken me nearly thirty years,&rdquo; said Mr. Wimbush. &ldquo;Twenty-five
      years of writing and nearly four of printing. And now it&rsquo;s finished&mdash;the
      whole chronicle, from Sir Ferdinando Lapith&rsquo;s birth to the death of my
      father William Wimbush&mdash;more than three centuries and a half: a
      history of Crome, written at Crome, and printed at Crome by my own press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we be allowed to read it now it&rsquo;s finished?&rdquo; asked Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wimbush nodded. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I hope you will not find it
      uninteresting,&rdquo; he added modestly. &ldquo;Our muniment room is particularly rich
      in ancient records, and I have some genuinely new light to throw on the
      introduction of the three-pronged fork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the people?&rdquo; asked Gombauld. &ldquo;Sir Ferdinando and the rest of them&mdash;were
      they amusing? Were there any crimes or tragedies in the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; Henry Wimbush rubbed his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;I can only
      think of two suicides, one violent death, four or perhaps five broken
      hearts, and half a dozen little blots on the scutcheon in the way of
      misalliances, seductions, natural children, and the like. No, on the
      whole, it&rsquo;s a placid and uneventful record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wimbushes and the Lapiths were always an unadventurous, respectable
      crew,&rdquo; said Priscilla, with a note of scorn in her voice. &ldquo;If I were to
      write my family history now! Why, it would be one long continuous blot
      from beginning to end.&rdquo; She laughed jovially, and helped herself to
      another glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to write mine,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan remarked, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t exist. After
      the second generation we Scogans are lost in the mists of antiquity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After dinner,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush, a little piqued by his wife&rsquo;s
      disparaging comment on the masters of Crome, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read you an episode
      from my History that will make you admit that even the Lapiths, in their
      own respectable way, had their tragedies and strange adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Priscilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to hear what?&rdquo; asked Jenny, emerging suddenly from her private
      interior world like a cuckoo from a clock. She received an explanation,
      smiled, nodded, cuckooed at last &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; and popped back, clapping shut
      the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was eaten; the party had adjourned to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush, pulling up a chair to the lamp. He put on his
      round pince-nez, rimmed with tortoise-shell, and began cautiously to turn
      over the pages of his loose and still fragmentary book. He found his place
      at last. &ldquo;Shall I begin?&rdquo; he asked, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Priscilla, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of an attentive silence Mr. Wimbush gave a little preliminary
      cough and started to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The infant who was destined to become the fourth baronet of the name of
      Lapith was born in the year 1740. He was a very small baby, weighing not
      more than three pounds at birth, but from the first he was sturdy and
      healthy. In honour of his maternal grandfather, Sir Hercules Occam of
      Bishop&rsquo;s Occam, he was christened Hercules. His mother, like many other
      mothers, kept a notebook, in which his progress from month to month was
      recorded. He walked at ten months, and before his second year was out he
      had learnt to speak a number of words. At three years he weighed but
      twenty-four pounds, and at six, though he could read and write perfectly
      and showed a remarkable aptitude for music, he was no larger and heavier
      than a well-grown child of two. Meanwhile, his mother had borne two other
      children, a boy and a girl, one of whom died of croup during infancy,
      while the other was carried off by smallpox before it reached the age of
      five. Hercules remained the only surviving child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his twelfth birthday Hercules was still only three feet and two inches
      in height. His head, which was very handsome and nobly shaped, was too big
      for his body, but otherwise he was exquisitely proportioned, and, for his
      size, of great strength and agility. His parents, in the hope of making
      him grow, consulted all the most eminent physicians of the time. Their
      various prescriptions were followed to the letter, but in vain. One
      ordered a very plentiful meat diet; another exercise; a third constructed
      a little rack, modelled on those employed by the Holy Inquisition, on
      which young Hercules was stretched, with excruciating torments, for half
      an hour every morning and evening. In the course of the next three years
      Hercules gained perhaps two inches. After that his growth stopped
      completely, and he remained for the rest of his life a pigmy of three feet
      and four inches. His father, who had built the most extravagant hopes upon
      his son, planning for him in his imagination a military career equal to
      that of Marlborough, found himself a disappointed man. &lsquo;I have brought an
      abortion into the world,&rsquo; he would say, and he took so violent a dislike
      to his son that the boy dared scarcely come into his presence. His temper,
      which had been serene, was turned by disappointment to moroseness and
      savagery. He avoided all company (being, as he said, ashamed to show
      himself, the father of a lusus naturae, among normal, healthy human
      beings), and took to solitary drinking, which carried him very rapidly to
      his grave; for the year before Hercules came of age his father was taken
      off by an apoplexy. His mother, whose love for him had increased with the
      growth of his father&rsquo;s unkindness, did not long survive, but little more
      than a year after her husband&rsquo;s death succumbed, after eating two dozen of
      oysters, to an attack of typhoid fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hercules thus found himself at the age of twenty-one alone in the world,
      and master of a considerable fortune, including the estate and mansion of
      Crome. The beauty and intelligence of his childhood had survived into his
      manly age, and, but for his dwarfish stature, he would have taken his
      place among the handsomest and most accomplished young men of his time. He
      was well read in the Greek and Latin authors, as well as in all the
      moderns of any merit who had written in English, French, or Italian. He
      had a good ear for music, and was no indifferent performer on the violin,
      which he used to play like a bass viol, seated on a chair with the
      instrument between his legs. To the music of the harpsichord and
      clavichord he was extremely partial, but the smallness of his hands made
      it impossible for him ever to perform upon these instruments. He had a
      small ivory flute made for him, on which, whenever he was melancholy, he
      used to play a simple country air or jig, affirming that this rustic music
      had more power to clear and raise the spirits than the most artificial
      productions of the masters. From an early age he practised the composition
      of poetry, but, though conscious of his great powers in this art, he would
      never publish any specimen of his writing. &lsquo;My stature,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;is
      reflected in my verses; if the public were to read them it would not be
      because I am a poet, but because I am a dwarf.&rsquo; Several MS. books of Sir
      Hercules&rsquo;s poems survive. A single specimen will suffice to illustrate his
      qualities as a poet.&rdquo;

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as he came into the estate, Sir Hercules set about remodelling
      his household. For though by no means ashamed of his deformity&mdash;indeed,
      if we may judge from the poem quoted above, he regarded himself as being
      in many ways superior to the ordinary race of man&mdash;he found the
      presence of full-grown men and women embarrassing. Realising, too, that he
      must abandon all ambitions in the great world, he determined to retire
      absolutely from it and to create, as it were, at Crome a private world of
      his own, in which all should be proportionable to himself. Accordingly, he
      discharged all the old servants of the house and replaced them gradually,
      as he was able to find suitable successors, by others of dwarfish stature.
      In the course of a few years he had assembled about himself a numerous
      household, no member of which was above four feet high and the smallest
      among them scarcely two feet and six inches. His father&rsquo;s dogs, such as
      setters, mastiffs, greyhounds, and a pack of beagles, he sold or gave away
      as too large and too boisterous for his house, replacing them by pugs and
      King Charles spaniels and whatever other breeds of dog were the smallest.
      His father&rsquo;s stable was also sold. For his own use, whether riding or
      driving, he had six black Shetland ponies, with four very choice piebald
      animals of New Forest breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having thus settled his household entirely to his own satisfaction, it
      only remained for him to find some suitable companion with whom to share
      his paradise. Sir Hercules had a susceptible heart, and had more than
      once, between the ages of sixteen and twenty, felt what it was to love.
      But here his deformity had been a source of the most bitter humiliation,
      for, having once dared to declare himself to a young lady of his choice,
      he had been received with laughter. On his persisting, she had picked him
      up and shaken him like an importunate child, telling him to run away and
      plague her no more. The story soon got about&mdash;indeed, the young lady
      herself used to tell it as a particularly pleasant anecdote&mdash;and the
      taunts and mockery it occasioned were a source of the most acute distress
      to Hercules. From the poems written at this period we gather that he
      meditated taking his own life. In course of time, however, he lived down
      this humiliation; but never again, though he often fell in love, and that
      very passionately, did he dare to make any advances to those in whom he
      was interested. After coming to the estate and finding that he was in a
      position to create his own world as he desired it, he saw that, if he was
      to have a wife&mdash;which he very much desired, being of an affectionate
      and, indeed, amorous temper&mdash;he must choose her as he had chosen his
      servants&mdash;from among the race of dwarfs. But to find a suitable wife
      was, he found, a matter of some difficulty; for he would marry none who
      was not distinguished by beauty and gentle birth. The dwarfish daughter of
      Lord Bemboro he refused on the ground that besides being a pigmy she was
      hunchbacked; while another young lady, an orphan belonging to a very good
      family in Hampshire, was rejected by him because her face, like that of so
      many dwarfs, was wizened and repulsive. Finally, when he was almost
      despairing of success, he heard from a reliable source that Count
      Titimalo, a Venetian nobleman, possessed a daughter of exquisite beauty
      and great accomplishments, who was by three feet in height. Setting out at
      once for Venice, he went immediately on his arrival to pay his respects to
      the count, whom he found living with his wife and five children in a very
      mean apartment in one of the poorer quarters of the town. Indeed, the
      count was so far reduced in his circumstances that he was even then
      negotiating (so it was rumoured) with a travelling company of clowns and
      acrobats, who had had the misfortune to lose their performing dwarf, for
      the sale of his diminutive daughter Filomena. Sir Hercules arrived in time
      to save her from this untoward fate, for he was so much charmed by
      Filomena&rsquo;s grace and beauty, that at the end of three days&rsquo; courtship he
      made her a formal offer of marriage, which was accepted by her no less
      joyfully than by her father, who perceived in an English son-in-law a rich
      and unfailing source of revenue. After an unostentatious marriage, at
      which the English ambassador acted as one of the witnesses, Sir Hercules
      and his bride returned by sea to England, where they settled down, as it
      proved, to a life of uneventful happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crome and its household of dwarfs delighted Filomena, who felt herself
      now for the first time to be a free woman living among her equals in a
      friendly world. She had many tastes in common with her husband, especially
      that of music. She had a beautiful voice, of a power surprising in one so
      small, and could touch A in alt without effort. Accompanied by her husband
      on his fine Cremona fiddle, which he played, as we have noted before, as
      one plays a bass viol, she would sing all the liveliest and tenderest airs
      from the operas and cantatas of her native country. Seated together at the
      harpsichord, they found that they could with their four hands play all the
      music written for two hands of ordinary size, a circumstance which gave
      Sir Hercules unfailing pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they were not making music or reading together, which they often
      did, both in English and Italian, they spent their time in healthful
      outdoor exercises, sometimes rowing in a little boat on the lake, but more
      often riding or driving, occupations in which, because they were entirely
      new to her, Filomena especially delighted. When she had become a perfectly
      proficient rider, Filomena and her husband used often to go hunting in the
      park, at that time very much more extensive than it is now. They hunted
      not foxes nor hares, but rabbits, using a pack of about thirty black and
      fawn-coloured pugs, a kind of dog which, when not overfed, can course a
      rabbit as well as any of the smaller breeds. Four dwarf grooms, dressed in
      scarlet liveries and mounted on white Exmoor ponies, hunted the pack,
      while their master and mistress, in green habits, followed either on the
      black Shetlands or on the piebald New Forest ponies. A picture of the
      whole hunt&mdash;dogs, horses, grooms, and masters&mdash;was painted by
      William Stubbs, whose work Sir Hercules admired so much that he invited
      him, though a man of ordinary stature, to come and stay at the mansion for
      the purpose of executing this picture. Stubbs likewise painted a portrait
      of Sir Hercules and his lady driving in their green enamelled calash drawn
      by four black Shetlands. Sir Hercules wears a plum-coloured velvet coat
      and white breeches; Filomena is dressed in flowered muslin and a very
      large hat with pink feathers. The two figures in their gay carriage stand
      out sharply against a dark background of trees; but to the left of the
      picture the trees fall away and disappear, so that the four black ponies
      are seen against a pale and strangely lurid sky that has the golden-brown
      colour of thunder-clouds lighted up by the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way four years passed happily by. At the end of that time
      Filomena found herself great with child. Sir Hercules was overjoyed. &lsquo;If
      God is good,&rsquo; he wrote in his day-book, &lsquo;the name of Lapith will be
      preserved and our rarer and more delicate race transmitted through the
      generations until in the fullness of time the world shall recognise the
      superiority of those beings whom now it uses to make mock of.&rsquo; On his
      wife&rsquo;s being brought to bed of a son he wrote a poem to the same effect.
      The child was christened Ferdinando in memory of the builder of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the passage of the months a certain sense of disquiet began to
      invade the minds of Sir Hercules and his lady. For the child was growing
      with an extraordinary rapidity. At a year he weighed as much as Hercules
      had weighed when he was three. &lsquo;Ferdinando goes crescendo,&rsquo; wrote Filomena
      in her diary. &lsquo;It seems not natural.&rsquo; At eighteen months the baby was
      almost as tall as their smallest jockey, who was a man of thirty-six.
      Could it be that Ferdinando was destined to become a man of the normal,
      gigantic dimensions? It was a thought to which neither of his parents
      dared yet give open utterance, but in the secrecy of their respective
      diaries they brooded over it in terror and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his third birthday Ferdinando was taller than his mother and not more
      than a couple of inches short of his father&rsquo;s height. &lsquo;To-day for the
      first time&rsquo; wrote Sir Hercules, &lsquo;we discussed the situation. The hideous
      truth can be concealed no longer: Ferdinando is not one of us. On this,
      his third birthday, a day when we should have been rejoicing at the
      health, the strength, and beauty of our child, we wept together over the
      ruin of our happiness. God give us strength to bear this cross.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the age of eight Ferdinando was so large and so exuberantly healthy
      that his parents decided, though reluctantly, to send him to school. He
      was packed off to Eton at the beginning of the next half. A profound peace
      settled upon the house. Ferdinando returned for the summer holidays larger
      and stronger than ever. One day he knocked down the butler and broke his
      arm. &lsquo;He is rough, inconsiderate, unamenable to persuasion,&rsquo; wrote his
      father. &lsquo;The only thing that will teach him manners is corporal
      chastisement.&rsquo; Ferdinando, who at this age was already seventeen inches
      taller than his father, received no corporal chastisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One summer holidays about three years later Ferdinando returned to Crome
      accompanied by a very large mastiff dog. He had bought it from an old man
      at Windsor who had found the beast too expensive to feed. It was a savage,
      unreliable animal; hardly had it entered the house when it attacked one of
      Sir Hercules&rsquo;s favourite pugs, seizing the creature in its jaws and
      shaking it till it was nearly dead. Extremely put out by this occurrence,
      Sir Hercules ordered that the beast should be chained up in the
      stable-yard. Ferdinando sullenly answered that the dog was his, and he
      would keep it where he pleased. His father, growing angry, bade him take
      the animal out of the house at once, on pain of his utmost displeasure.
      Ferdinando refused to move. His mother at this moment coming into the
      room, the dog flew at her, knocked her down, and in a twinkling had very
      severely mauled her arm and shoulder; in another instant it must
      infallibly have had her by the throat, had not Sir Hercules drawn his
      sword and stabbed the animal to the heart. Turning on his son, he ordered
      him to leave the room immediately, as being unfit to remain in the same
      place with the mother whom he had nearly murdered. So awe-inspiring was
      the spectacle of Sir Hercules standing with one foot on the carcase of the
      gigantic dog, his sword drawn and still bloody, so commanding were his
      voice, his gestures, and the expression of his face that Ferdinando slunk
      out of the room in terror and behaved himself for all the rest of the
      vacation in an entirely exemplary fashion. His mother soon recovered from
      the bites of the mastiff, but the effect on her mind of this adventure was
      ineradicable; from that time forth she lived always among imaginary
      terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two years which Ferdinando spent on the Continent, making the Grand
      Tour, were a period of happy repose for his parents. But even now the
      thought of the future haunted them; nor were they able to solace
      themselves with all the diversions of their younger days. The Lady
      Filomena had lost her voice and Sir Hercules was grown too rheumatical to
      play the violin. He, it is true, still rode after his pugs, but his wife
      felt herself too old and, since the episode of the mastiff, too nervous
      for such sports. At most, to please her husband, she would follow the hunt
      at a distance in a little gig drawn by the safest and oldest of the
      Shetlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day fixed for Ferdinando&rsquo;s return came round. Filomena, sick with
      vague dreads and presentiments, retired to her chamber and her bed. Sir
      Hercules received his son alone. A giant in a brown travelling-suit
      entered the room. &lsquo;Welcome home, my son,&rsquo; said Sir Hercules in a voice
      that trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I hope I see you well, sir.&rsquo; Ferdinando bent down to shake hands, then
      straightened himself up again. The top of his father&rsquo;s head reached to the
      level of his hip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferdinando had not come alone. Two friends of his own age accompanied
      him, and each of the young men had brought a servant. Not for thirty years
      had Crome been desecrated by the presence of so many members of the common
      race of men. Sir Hercules was appalled and indignant, but the laws of
      hospitality had to be obeyed. He received the young gentlemen with grave
      politeness and sent the servants to the kitchen, with orders that they
      should be well cared for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old family dining-table was dragged out into the light and dusted
      (Sir Hercules and his lady were accustomed to dine at a small table twenty
      inches high). Simon, the aged butler, who could only just look over the
      edge of the big table, was helped at supper by the three servants brought
      by Ferdinando and his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Hercules presided, and with his usual grace supported a conversation
      on the pleasures of foreign travel, the beauties of art and nature to be
      met with abroad, the opera at Venice, the singing of the orphans in the
      churches of the same city, and on other topics of a similar nature. The
      young men were not particularly attentive to his discourses; they were
      occupied in watching the efforts of the butler to change the plates and
      replenish the glasses. They covered their laughter by violent and repeated
      fits of coughing or choking. Sir Hercules affected not to notice, but
      changed the subject of the conversation to sport. Upon this one of the
      young men asked whether it was true, as he had heard, that he used to hunt
      the rabbit with a pack of pug dogs. Sir Hercules replied that it was, and
      proceeded to describe the chase in some detail. The young men roared with
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When supper was over, Sir Hercules climbed down from his chair and,
      giving as his excuse that he must see how his lady did, bade them
      good-night. The sound of laughter followed him up the stairs. Filomena was
      not asleep; she had been lying on her bed listening to the sound of
      enormous laughter and the tread of strangely heavy feet on the stairs and
      along the corridors. Sir Hercules drew a chair to her bedside and sat
      there for a long time in silence, holding his wife&rsquo;s hand and sometimes
      gently squeezing it. At about ten o&rsquo;clock they were startled by a violent
      noise. There was a breaking of glass, a stamping of feet, with an outburst
      of shouts and laughter. The uproar continuing for several minutes, Sir
      Hercules rose to his feet and, in spite of his wife&rsquo;s entreaties, prepared
      to go and see what was happening. There was no light on the staircase, and
      Sir Hercules groped his way down cautiously, lowering himself from stair
      to stair and standing for a moment on each tread before adventuring on a
      new step. The noise was louder here; the shouting articulated itself into
      recognisable words and phrases. A line of light was visible under the
      dining-room door. Sir Hercules tiptoed across the hall towards it. Just as
      he approached the door there was another terrific crash of breaking glass
      and jangled metal. What could they be doing? Standing on tiptoe he managed
      to look through the keyhole. In the middle of the ravaged table old Simon,
      the butler, so primed with drink that he could scarcely keep his balance,
      was dancing a jig. His feet crunched and tinkled among the broken glass,
      and his shoes were wet with spilt wine. The three young men sat round,
      thumping the table with their hands or with the empty wine bottles,
      shouting and laughing encouragement. The three servants leaning against
      the wall laughed too. Ferdinando suddenly threw a handful of walnuts at
      the dancer&rsquo;s head, which so dazed and surprised the little man that he
      staggered and fell down on his back, upsetting a decanter and several
      glasses. They raised him up, gave him some brandy to drink, thumped him on
      the back. The old man smiled and hiccoughed. &lsquo;To-morrow,&rsquo; said Ferdinando,
      &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll have a concerted ballet of the whole household.&rsquo; &lsquo;With father
      Hercules wearing his club and lion-skin,&rsquo; added one of his companions, and
      all three roared with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Hercules would look and listen no further. He crossed the hall once
      more and began to climb the stairs, lifting his knees painfully high at
      each degree. This was the end; there was no place for him now in the
      world, no place for him and Ferdinando together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife was still awake; to her questioning glance he answered, &lsquo;They
      are making mock of old Simon. To-morrow it will be our turn.&rsquo; They were
      silent for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last Filomena said, &lsquo;I do not want to see to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is better not,&rsquo; said Sir Hercules. Going into his closet he wrote in
      his day-book a full and particular account of all the events of the
      evening. While he was still engaged in this task he rang for a servant and
      ordered hot water and a bath to be made ready for him at eleven o&rsquo;clock.
      When he had finished writing he went into his wife&rsquo;s room, and preparing a
      dose of opium twenty times as strong as that which she was accustomed to
      take when she could not sleep, he brought it to her, saying, &lsquo;Here is your
      sleeping-draught.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Filomena took the glass and lay for a little time, but did not drink
      immediately. The tears came into her eyes. &lsquo;Do you remember the songs we
      used to sing, sitting out there sulla terrazza in the summer-time?&rsquo; She
      began singing softly in her ghost of a cracked voice a few bars from
      Stradella&rsquo;s &lsquo;Amor amor, non dormir piu.&rsquo; &lsquo;And you playing on the violin,
      it seems such a short time ago, and yet so long, long, long. Addio, amore,
      a rivederti.&rsquo; She drank off the draught and, lying back on the pillow,
      closed her eyes. Sir Hercules kissed her hand and tiptoed away, as though
      he were afraid of waking her. He returned to his closet, and having
      recorded his wife&rsquo;s last words to him, he poured into his bath the water
      that had been brought up in accordance with his orders. The water being
      too hot for him to get into the bath at once, he took down from the shelf
      his copy of Suetonius. He wished to read how Seneca had died. He opened
      the book at random. &lsquo;But dwarfs,&rsquo; he read, &lsquo;he held in abhorrence as being
      lusus naturae and of evil omen.&rsquo; He winced as though he had been struck.
      This same Augustus, he remembered, had exhibited in the amphitheatre a
      young man called Lucius, of good family, who was not quite two feet in
      height and weighed seventeen pounds, but had a stentorian voice. He turned
      over the pages. Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero: it was a tale of
      growing horror. &lsquo;Seneca his preceptor, he forced to kill himself.&rsquo; And
      there was Petronius, who had called his friends about him at the last,
      bidding them talk to him, not of the consolations of philosophy, but of
      love and gallantry, while the life was ebbing away through his opened
      veins. Dipping his pen once more in the ink he wrote on the last page of
      his diary: &lsquo;He died a Roman death.&rsquo; Then, putting the toes of one foot
      into the water and finding that it was not too hot, he threw off his
      dressing-gown and, taking a razor in his hand, sat down in the bath. With
      one deep cut he severed the artery in his left wrist, then lay back and
      composed his mind to meditation. The blood oozed out, floating through the
      water in dissolving wreaths and spirals. In a little while the whole bath
      was tinged with pink. The colour deepened; Sir Hercules felt himself
      mastered by an invincible drowsiness; he was sinking from vague dream to
      dream. Soon he was sound asleep. There was not much blood in his small
      body.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or their
      after-luncheon coffee the party generally adjourned to the library. Its
      windows looked east, and at this hour of the day it was the coolest place
      in the whole house. It was a large room, fitted, during the eighteenth
      century, with white painted shelves of an elegant design. In the middle of
      one wall a door, ingeniously upholstered with rows of dummy books, gave
      access to a deep cupboard, where, among a pile of letter-files and old
      newspapers, the mummy-case of an Egyptian lady, brought back by the second
      Sir Ferdinando on his return from the Grand Tour, mouldered in the
      darkness. From ten yards away and at a first glance, one might almost have
      mistaken this secret door for a section of shelving filled with genuine
      books. Coffee-cup in hand, Mr. Scogan was standing in front of the dummy
      book-shelf. Between the sips he discoursed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bottom shelf,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;is taken up by an Encyclopaedia in
      fourteen volumes. Useful, but a little dull, as is also Caprimulge&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Dictionary of the Finnish Language&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Biographical Dictionary&rsquo; looks
      more promising. &lsquo;Biography of Men who were Born Great&rsquo;, &lsquo;Biography of Men
      who Achieved Greatness&rsquo;, &lsquo;Biography of Men who had Greatness Thrust upon
      Them&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Biography of Men who were Never Great at All&rsquo;. Then there are
      ten volumes of &lsquo;Thom&rsquo;s Works and Wanderings&rsquo;, while the &lsquo;Wild Goose Chase,
      a Novel&rsquo;, by an anonymous author, fills no less than six. But what&rsquo;s this,
      what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan stood on tiptoe and peered up. &ldquo;Seven volumes of
      the &lsquo;Tales of Knockespotch&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Tales of Knockespotch&rsquo;,&rdquo; he repeated.
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Henry,&rdquo; he said, turning round, &ldquo;these are your best books. I
      would willingly give all the rest of your library for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The happy possessor of a multitude of first editions, Mr. Wimbush could
      afford to smile indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan went on, &ldquo;that they possess nothing more than
      a back and a title?&rdquo; He opened the cupboard door and peeped inside, as
      though he hoped to find the rest of the books behind it. &ldquo;Phooh!&rdquo; he said,
      and shut the door again. &ldquo;It smells of dust and mildew. How symbolical!
      One comes to the great masterpieces of the past, expecting some miraculous
      illumination, and one finds, on opening them, only darkness and dust and a
      faint smell of decay. After all, what is reading but a vice, like drink or
      venery or any other form of excessive self-indulgence? One reads to tickle
      and amuse one&rsquo;s mind; one reads, above all, to prevent oneself thinking.
      Still&mdash;the &lsquo;Tales of Knockespotch&rsquo;...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and thoughtfully drummed with his fingers on the backs of the
      non-existent, unattainable books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I disagree with you about reading,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;About serious
      reading, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Mary, quite right,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan answered. &ldquo;I had forgotten
      there were any serious people in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the idea of the Biographies,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s room for us all
      within the scheme; it&rsquo;s comprehensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Biographies are good, the Biographies are excellent,&rdquo; Mr Scogan
      agreed. &ldquo;I imagine them written in a very elegant Regency style&mdash;Brighton
      Pavilion in words&mdash;perhaps by the great Dr. Lempriere himself. You
      know his classical dictionary? Ah!&rdquo; Mr. Scogan raised his hand and let it
      limply fall again in a gesture which implied that words failed him. &ldquo;Read
      his biography of Helen; read how Jupiter, disguised as a swan, was
      &lsquo;enabled to avail himself of his situation&rsquo; vis-a-vis to Leda. And to
      think that he may have, must have written these biographies of the Great!
      What a work, Henry! And, owing to the idiotic arrangement of your library,
      it can&rsquo;t be read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer the &lsquo;Wild Goose Chase&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;A novel in six volumes&mdash;it
      must be restful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Restful,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan repeated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit on the right word. A &lsquo;Wild
      Goose Chase&rsquo; is sound, but a bit old-fashioned&mdash;pictures of clerical
      life in the fifties, you know; specimens of the landed gentry; peasants
      for pathos and comedy; and in the background, always the picturesque
      beauties of nature soberly described. All very good and solid, but, like
      certain puddings, just a little dull. Personally, I like much better the
      notion of &lsquo;Thom&rsquo;s Works and Wanderings&rsquo;. The eccentric Mr. Thom of Thom&rsquo;s
      Hill. Old Tom Thom, as his intimates used to call him. He spent ten years
      in Thibet organising the clarified butter industry on modern European
      lines, and was able to retire at thirty-six with a handsome fortune. The
      rest of his life he devoted to travel and ratiocination; here is the
      result.&rdquo; Mr. Scogan tapped the dummy books. &ldquo;And now we come to the &lsquo;Tales
      of Knockespotch&rsquo;. What a masterpiece and what a great man! Knockespotch
      knew how to write fiction. Ah, Denis, if you could only read Knockespotch
      you wouldn&rsquo;t be writing a novel about the wearisome development of a young
      man&rsquo;s character, you wouldn&rsquo;t be describing in endless, fastidious detail,
      cultured life in Chelsea and Bloomsbury and Hampstead. You would be trying
      to write a readable book. But then, alas! owing to the peculiar
      arrangement of our host&rsquo;s library, you never will read Knockespotch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody could regret the fact more than I do,&rdquo; said Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Knockespotch,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan continued, &ldquo;the great Knockespotch, who
      delivered us from the dreary tyranny of the realistic novel. My life,
      Knockespotch said, is not so long that I can afford to spend precious
      hours writing or reading descriptions of middle-class interiors. He said
      again, &lsquo;I am tired of seeing the human mind bogged in a social plenum; I
      prefer to paint it in a vacuum, freely and sportively bombinating.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Gombauld, &ldquo;Knockespotch was a little obscure sometimes,
      wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan replied, &ldquo;and with intention. It made him seem even
      profounder than he actually was. But it was only in his aphorisms that he
      was so dark and oracular. In his Tales he was always luminous. Oh, those
      Tales&mdash;those Tales! How shall I describe them? Fabulous characters
      shoot across his pages like gaily dressed performers on the trapeze. There
      are extraordinary adventures and still more extraordinary speculations.
      Intelligences and emotions, relieved of all the imbecile preoccupations of
      civilised life, move in intricate and subtle dances, crossing and
      recrossing, advancing, retreating, impinging. An immense erudition and an
      immense fancy go hand in hand. All the ideas of the present and of the
      past, on every possible subject, bob up among the Tales, smile gravely or
      grimace a caricature of themselves, then disappear to make place for
      something new. The verbal surface of his writing is rich and fantastically
      diversified. The wit is incessant. The...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t you give us a specimen,&rdquo; Denis broke in&mdash;&ldquo;a concrete
      example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; Mr. Scogan replied, &ldquo;Knockespotch&rsquo;s great book is like the sword
      Excalibur. It remains struck fast in this door, awaiting the coming of a
      writer with genius enough to draw it forth. I am not even a writer, I am
      not so much as qualified to attempt the task. The extraction of
      Knockespotch from his wooden prison I leave, my dear Denis, to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Denis.

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the time of the
      amiable Brantome,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan was saying, &ldquo;every debutante at the French
      Court was invited to dine at the King&rsquo;s table, where she was served with
      wine in a handsome silver cup of Italian workmanship. It was no ordinary
      cup, this goblet of the debutantes; for, inside, it had been most
      curiously and ingeniously engraved with a series of very lively amorous
      scenes. With each draught that the young lady swallowed these engravings
      became increasingly visible, and the Court looked on with interest, every
      time she put her nose in the cup, to see whether she blushed at what the
      ebbing wine revealed. If the debutante blushed, they laughed at her for
      her innocence; if she did not, she was laughed at for being too knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you propose,&rdquo; asked Anne, &ldquo;that the custom should be revived at
      Buckingham Palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;I merely quoted the anecdote as an
      illustration of the customs, so genially frank, of the sixteenth century.
      I might have quoted other anecdotes to show that the customs of the
      seventeenth and eighteenth, of the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries, and
      indeed of every other century, from the time of Hammurabi onward, were
      equally genial and equally frank. The only century in which customs were
      not characterised by the same cheerful openness was the nineteenth, of
      blessed memory. It was the astonishing exception. And yet, with what one
      must suppose was a deliberate disregard of history, it looked upon its
      horribly pregnant silences as normal and natural and right; the frankness
      of the previous fifteen or twenty thousand years was considered abnormal
      and perverse. It was a curious phenomenon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entirely agree.&rdquo; Mary panted with excitement in her effort to bring out
      what she had to say. &ldquo;Havelock Ellis says...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan, like a policeman arresting the flow of traffic, held up his
      hand. &ldquo;He does; I know. And that brings me to my next point: the nature of
      the reaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havelock Ellis...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reaction, when it came&mdash;and we may say roughly that it set in a
      little before the beginning of this century&mdash;the reaction was to
      openness, but not to the same openness as had reigned in the earlier ages.
      It was to a scientific openness, not to the jovial frankness of the past,
      that we returned. The whole question of Amour became a terribly serious
      one. Earnest young men wrote in the public prints that from this time
      forth it would be impossible ever again to make a joke of any sexual
      matter. Professors wrote thick books in which sex was sterilised and
      dissected. It has become customary for serious young women, like Mary, to
      discuss, with philosophic calm, matters of which the merest hint would
      have sufficed to throw the youth of the sixties into a delirium of amorous
      excitement. It is all very estimable, no doubt. But still&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
      Scogan sighed.&mdash;&ldquo;I for one should like to see, mingled with this
      scientific ardour, a little more of the jovial spirit of Rabelais and
      Chaucer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entirely disagree with you,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Sex isn&rsquo;t a laughing matter;
      it&rsquo;s serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Mr. Scogan, &ldquo;perhaps I&rsquo;m an obscene old man. For I
      must confess that I cannot always regard it as wholly serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you...&rdquo; began Mary furiously. Her face had flushed with
      excitement. Her cheeks were the cheeks of a great ripe peach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan continued, &ldquo;it seems to me one of few permanently and
      everlastingly amusing subjects that exist. Amour is the one human activity
      of any importance in which laughter and pleasure preponderate, if ever so
      slightly, over misery and pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entirely disagree,&rdquo; said Mary. There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked at her watch. &ldquo;Nearly a quarter to eight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder
      when Ivor will turn up.&rdquo; She got up from her deck-chair and, leaning her
      elbows on the balustrade of the terrace, looked out over the valley and
      towards the farther hills. Under the level evening light the architecture
      of the land revealed itself. The deep shadows, the bright contrasting
      lights gave the hills a new solidity. Irregularities of the surface,
      unsuspected before, were picked out with light and shade. The grass, the
      corn, the foliage of trees were stippled with intricate shadows. The
      surface of things had taken on a marvellous enrichment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Anne suddenly, and pointed. On the opposite side of the
      valley, at the crest of the ridge, a cloud of dust flushed by the sunlight
      to rosy gold was moving rapidly along the sky-line. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ivor. One can
      tell by the speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dust cloud descended into the valley and was lost. A horn with the
      voice of a sea-lion made itself heard, approaching. A minute later Ivor
      came leaping round the corner of the house. His hair waved in the wind of
      his own speed; he laughed as he saw them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, darling,&rdquo; he cried, and embraced her, embraced Mary, very nearly
      embraced Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;Well, here I am. I&rsquo;ve come with incredulous speed.&rdquo;
       Ivor&rsquo;s vocabulary was rich, but a little erratic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not late for
      dinner, am I?&rdquo; He hoisted himself up on to the balustrade, and sat there,
      kicking his heels. With one arm he embraced a large stone flower-pot,
      leaning his head sideways against its hard and lichenous flanks in an
      attitude of trustful affection. He had brown, wavy hair, and his eyes were
      of a very brilliant, pale, improbable blue. His head was narrow, his face
      thin and rather long, his nose aquiline. In old age&mdash;though it was
      difficult to imagine Ivor old&mdash;he might grow to have an Iron Ducal
      grimness. But now, at twenty-six, it was not the structure of his face
      that impressed one; it was its expression. That was charming and
      vivacious, and his smile was an irradiation. He was forever moving,
      restlessly and rapidly, but with an engaging gracefulness. His frail and
      slender body seemed to be fed by a spring of inexhaustible energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in time to answer a question,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;We were arguing
      whether Amour were a serious matter or no. What do you think? Is it
      serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious?&rdquo; echoed Ivor. &ldquo;Most certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; cried Mary triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in what sense serious?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean as an occupation. One can go on with it without ever getting
      bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can occupy oneself with it,&rdquo; Ivor continued, &ldquo;always and everywhere.
      Women are always wonderfully the same. Shapes vary a little, that&rsquo;s all.
      In Spain&rdquo;&mdash;with his free hand he described a series of ample curves&mdash;&ldquo;one
      can&rsquo;t pass them on the stairs. In England&rdquo;&mdash;he put the tip of his
      forefinger against the tip of his thumb and, lowering his hand, drew out
      this circle into an imaginary cylinder&mdash;&ldquo;In England they&rsquo;re tubular.
      But their sentiments are always the same. At least, I&rsquo;ve always found it
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to hear it,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan.

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he ladies had left
      the room and the port was circulating. Mr. Scogan filled his glass, passed
      on the decanter, and, leaning back in his chair, looked about him for a
      moment in silence. The conversation rippled idly round him, but he
      disregarded it; he was smiling at some private joke. Gombauld noticed his
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s amusing you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just looking at you all, sitting round this table,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Scogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we as comic as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan answered politely. &ldquo;I was merely amused by my own
      speculations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idlest, the most academic of speculations. I was looking at you one
      by one and trying to imagine which of the first six Caesars you would each
      resemble, if you were given the opportunity of behaving like a Caesar. The
      Caesars are one of my touchstones,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan explained. &ldquo;They are
      characters functioning, so to speak, in the void. They are human beings
      developed to their logical conclusions. Hence their unequalled value as a
      touchstone, a standard. When I meet someone for the first time, I ask
      myself this question: Given the Caesarean environment, which of the
      Caesars would this person resemble&mdash;Julius, Augustus, Tiberius,
      Caligula, Claudius, Nero? I take each trait of character, each mental and
      emotional bias, each little oddity, and magnify them a thousand times. The
      resulting image gives me his Caesarean formula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which of the Caesars do you resemble?&rdquo; asked Gombauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am potentially all of them,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan replied, &ldquo;all&mdash;with the
      possible exception of Claudius, who was much too stupid to be a
      development of anything in my character. The seeds of Julius&rsquo;s courage and
      compelling energy, of Augustus&rsquo;s prudence, of the libidinousness and
      cruelty of Tiberius, of Caligula&rsquo;s folly, of Nero&rsquo;s artistic genius and
      enormous vanity, are all within me. Given the opportunities, I might have
      been something fabulous. But circumstances were against me. I was born and
      brought up in a country rectory; I passed my youth doing a great deal of
      utterly senseless hard work for a very little money. The result is that
      now, in middle age, I am the poor thing that I am. But perhaps it is as
      well. Perhaps, too, it&rsquo;s as well that Denis hasn&rsquo;t been permitted to
      flower into a little Nero, and that Ivor remains only potentially a
      Caligula. Yes, it&rsquo;s better so, no doubt. But it would have been more
      amusing, as a spectacle, if they had had the chance to develop,
      untrammelled, the full horror of their potentialities. It would have been
      pleasant and interesting to watch their tics and foibles and little vices
      swelling and burgeoning and blossoming into enormous and fantastic flowers
      of cruelty and pride and lewdness and avarice. The Caesarean environment
      makes the Caesar, as the special food and the queenly cell make the queen
      bee. We differ from the bees in so far that, given the proper food, they
      can be sure of making a queen every time. With us there is no such
      certainty; out of every ten men placed in the Caesarean environment one
      will be temperamentally good, or intelligent, or great. The rest will
      blossom into Caesars; he will not. Seventy and eighty years ago
      simple-minded people, reading of the exploits of the Bourbons in South
      Italy, cried out in amazement: To think that such things should be
      happening in the nineteenth century! And a few years since we too were
      astonished to find that in our still more astonishing twentieth century,
      unhappy blackamoors on the Congo and the Amazon were being treated as
      English serfs were treated in the time of Stephen. To-day we are no longer
      surprised at these things. The Black and Tans harry Ireland, the Poles
      maltreat the Silesians, the bold Fascisti slaughter their poorer
      countrymen: we take it all for granted. Since the war we wonder at
      nothing. We have created a Caesarean environment and a host of little
      Caesars has sprung up. What could be more natural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan drank off what was left of his port and refilled the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this very moment,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the most frightful horrors are taking
      place in every corner of the world. People are being crushed, slashed,
      disembowelled, mangled; their dead bodies rot and their eyes decay with
      the rest. Screams of pain and fear go pulsing through the air at the rate
      of eleven hundred feet per second. After travelling for three seconds they
      are perfectly inaudible. These are distressing facts; but do we enjoy life
      any the less because of them? Most certainly we do not. We feel sympathy,
      no doubt; we represent to ourselves imaginatively the sufferings of
      nations and individuals and we deplore them. But, after all, what are
      sympathy and imagination? Precious little, unless the person for whom we
      feel sympathy happens to be closely involved in our affections; and even
      then they don&rsquo;t go very far. And a good thing too; for if one had an
      imagination vivid enough and a sympathy sufficiently sensitive really to
      comprehend and to feel the sufferings of other people, one would never
      have a moment&rsquo;s peace of mind. A really sympathetic race would not so much
      as know the meaning of happiness. But luckily, as I&rsquo;ve already said, we
      aren&rsquo;t a sympathetic race. At the beginning of the war I used to think I
      really suffered, through imagination and sympathy, with those who
      physically suffered. But after a month or two I had to admit that,
      honestly, I didn&rsquo;t. And yet I think I have a more vivid imagination than
      most. One is always alone in suffering; the fact is depressing when one
      happens to be the sufferer, but it makes pleasure possible for the rest of
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Henry Wimbush pushed back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think perhaps we ought to go and join the ladies,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Ivor, jumping up with alacrity. He turned to Mr. Scogan.
      &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can share our pleasures. We are not always
      condemned to be happy alone.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>vor brought his
      hands down with a bang on to the final chord of his rhapsody. There was
      just a hint in that triumphant harmony that the seventh had been struck
      along with the octave by the thumb of the left hand; but the general
      effect of splendid noise emerged clearly enough. Small details matter
      little so long as the general effect is good. And, besides, that hint of
      the seventh was decidedly modern. He turned round in his seat and tossed
      the hair back out of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best I can do for you, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murmurs of applause and gratitude were heard, and Mary, her large china
      eyes fixed on the performer, cried out aloud, &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; and gasped for
      new breath as though she were suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature and fortune had vied with one another in heaping on Ivor Lombard
      all their choicest gifts. He had wealth and he was perfectly independent.
      He was good looking, possessed an irresistible charm of manner, and was
      the hero of more amorous successes than he could well remember. His
      accomplishments were extraordinary for their number and variety. He had a
      beautiful untrained tenor voice; he could improvise, with a startling
      brilliance, rapidly and loudly, on the piano. He was a good amateur medium
      and telepathist, and had a considerable first-hand knowledge of the next
      world. He could write rhymed verses with an extraordinary rapidity. For
      painting symbolical pictures he had a dashing style, and if the drawing
      was sometimes a little weak, the colour was always pyrotechnical. He
      excelled in amateur theatricals and, when occasion offered, he could cook
      with genius. He resembled Shakespeare in knowing little Latin and less
      Greek. For a mind like his, education seemed supererogatory. Training
      would only have destroyed his natural aptitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out into the garden,&rdquo; Ivor suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, &ldquo;but I for one prefer these still more
      wonderful arm-chairs.&rdquo; His pipe had begun to bubble oozily every time he
      pulled at it. He was perfectly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Wimbush was also happy. He looked for a moment over his pince-nez in
      Ivor&rsquo;s direction and then, without saying anything, returned to the grimy
      little sixteenth-century account books which were now his favourite
      reading. He knew more about Sir Ferdinando&rsquo;s household expenses than about
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outdoor party, enrolled under Ivor&rsquo;s banner, consisted of Anne, Mary,
      Denis, and, rather unexpectedly, Jenny. Outside it was warm and dark;
      there was no moon. They walked up and down the terrace, and Ivor sang a
      Neapolitan song: &ldquo;Stretti, stretti&rdquo;&mdash;close, close&mdash;with
      something about the little Spanish girl to follow. The atmosphere began to
      palpitate. Ivor put his arm round Anne&rsquo;s waist, dropped his head sideways
      onto her shoulder, and in that position walked on, singing as he walked.
      It seemed the easiest, the most natural, thing in the world. Denis
      wondered why he had never done it. He hated Ivor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the pool,&rdquo; said Ivor. He disengaged his embrace and
      turned round to shepherd his little flock. They made their way along the
      side of the house to the entrance of the yew-tree walk that led down to
      the lower garden. Between the blank precipitous wall of the house and the
      tall yew trees the path was a chasm of impenetrable gloom. Somewhere there
      were steps down to the right, a gap in the yew hedge. Denis, who headed
      the party, groped his way cautiously; in this darkness, one had an
      irrational fear of yawning precipices, of horrible spiked obstructions.
      Suddenly from behind him he heard a shrill, startled, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and then a
      sharp, dry concussion that might have been the sound of a slap. After
      that, Jenny&rsquo;s voice was heard pronouncing, &ldquo;I am going back to the house.&rdquo;
       Her tone was decided, and even as she pronounced the words she was melting
      away into the darkness. The incident, whatever it had been, was closed.
      Denis resumed his forward groping. From somewhere behind Ivor began to
      sing again, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Phillis plus avare que tendre
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ne gagnant rien à refuser,

    <p class="indent15">
      Un jour exigea à Silvandre
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Trente moutons pour un baiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The melody drooped and climbed again with a kind of easy languor; the warm
      darkness seemed to pulse like blood about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Le lendemain, nouvelle affaire:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Pour le berger le troc fut bon...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the steps,&rdquo; cried Denis. He guided his companions over the
      danger, and in a moment they had the turf of the yew-tree walk under their
      feet. It was lighter here, or at least it was just perceptibly less dark;
      for the yew walk was wider than the path that had led them under the lea
      of the house. Looking up, they could see between the high black hedges a
      strip of sky and a few stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Car il obtint de la bergere...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Went on Ivor, and then interrupted himself to shout, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to run
      down,&rdquo; and he was off, full speed, down the invisible slope, singing
      unevenly as he went:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Trente baisers pour un mouton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The others followed. Denis shambled in the rear, vainly exhorting everyone
      to caution: the slope was steep, one might break one&rsquo;s neck. What was
      wrong with these people, he wondered? They had become like young kittens
      after a dose of cat-nip. He himself felt a certain kittenishness sporting
      within him; but it was, like all his emotions, rather a theoretical
      feeling; it did not overmasteringly seek to express itself in a practical
      demonstration of kittenishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; he shouted once more, and hardly were the words out of his
      mouth when, thump! there was the sound of a heavy fall in front of him,
      followed by the long &ldquo;F-f-f-f-f&rdquo; of a breath indrawn with pain and
      afterwards by a very sincere, &ldquo;Oo-ooh!&rdquo; Denis was almost pleased; he had
      told them so, the idiots, and they wouldn&rsquo;t listen. He trotted down the
      slope towards the unseen sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary came down the hill like a runaway steam-engine. It was tremendously
      exciting, this blind rush through the dark; she felt she would never stop.
      But the ground grew level beneath her feet, her speed insensibly
      slackened, and suddenly she was caught by an extended arm and brought to
      an abrupt halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ivor as he tightened his embrace, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re caught now, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made an effort to release herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Anne. It&rsquo;s Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivor burst into a peal of amused laughter. &ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I
      seem to be making nothing but floaters this evening. I&rsquo;ve already made one
      with Jenny.&rdquo; He laughed again, and there was something so jolly about his
      laughter that Mary could not help laughing too. He did not remove his
      encircling arm, and somehow it was all so amusing and natural that Mary
      made no further attempt to escape from it. They walked along by the side
      of the pool, interlaced. Mary was too short for him to be able, with any
      comfort, to lay his head on her shoulder. He rubbed his cheek, caressed
      and caressing, against the thick, sleek mass of her hair. In a little
      while he began to sing again; the night trembled amorously to the sound of
      his voice. When he had finished he kissed her. Anne or Mary: Mary or Anne.
      It didn&rsquo;t seem to make much difference which it was. There were
      differences in detail, of course; but the general effect was the same;
      and, after all, the general effect was the important thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis made his way down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any damage done?&rdquo; he called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Denis? I&rsquo;ve hurt my ankle so&mdash;and my knee, and my hand.
      I&rsquo;m all in pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Anne,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t help adding, &ldquo;it was
      silly to start running downhill in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ass!&rdquo; she retorted in a tone of tearful irritation; &ldquo;of course it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down beside her on the grass, and found himself breathing the
      faint, delicious atmosphere of perfume that she carried always with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light a match,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;I want to look at my wounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pockets for the match-box. The light spurted and then grew
      steady. Magically, a little universe had been created, a world of colours
      and forms&mdash;Anne&rsquo;s face, the shimmering orange of her dress, her
      white, bare arms, a patch of green turf&mdash;and round about a darkness
      that had become solid and utterly blind. Anne held out her hands; both
      were green and earthy with her fall, and the left exhibited two or three
      red abrasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so bad,&rdquo; she said. But Denis was terribly distressed, and his emotion
      was intensified when, looking up at her face, he saw that the trace of
      tears, involuntary tears of pain, lingered on her eyelashes. He pulled out
      his handkerchief and began to wipe away the dirt from the wounded hand.
      The match went out; it was not worth while to light another. Anne allowed
      herself to be attended to, meekly and gratefully. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said,
      when he had finished cleaning and bandaging her hand; and there was
      something in her tone that made him feel that she had lost her superiority
      over him, that she was younger than he, had become, suddenly, almost a
      child. He felt tremendously large and protective. The feeling was so
      strong that instinctively he put his arm about her. She drew closer,
      leaned against him, and so they sat in silence. Then, from below, soft but
      wonderfully clear through the still darkness, they heard the sound of
      Ivor&rsquo;s singing. He was going on with his half-finished song:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Le lendemain Phillis plus tendre,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ne voulant deplaire au berger,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Fut trop heureuse de lui rendre
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Trente moutons pour un baiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rather prolonged pause. It was as though time were being
      allowed for the giving and receiving of a few of those thirty kisses. Then
      the voice sang on:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Le lendemain Phillis peu sage
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Aurait donne moutons et chien
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Pour un baiser que le volage
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      À Lisette donnait pour rien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The last note died away into an uninterrupted silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better?&rdquo; Denis whispered. &ldquo;Are you comfortable like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded a Yes to both questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trente moutons pour un baiser.&rdquo; The sheep, the woolly mutton&mdash;baa,
      baa, baa...? Or the shepherd? Yes, decidedly, he felt himself to be the
      shepherd now. He was the master, the protector. A wave of courage swelled
      through him, warm as wine. He turned his head, and began to kiss her face,
      at first rather randomly, then, with more precision, on the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne averted her head; he kissed the ear, the smooth nape that this
      movement presented him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she protested; &ldquo;no, Denis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It spoils our friendship, and that was so jolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to explain. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t...it isn&rsquo;t our
      stunt at all.&rdquo; It was true. Somehow she had never thought of Denis in the
      light of a man who might make love; she had never so much as conceived the
      possibilities of an amorous relationship with him. He was so absurdly
      young, so...so...she couldn&rsquo;t find the adjective, but she knew what she
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it our stunt?&rdquo; asked Denis. &ldquo;And, by the way, that&rsquo;s a horrible
      and inappropriate expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I say it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes no difference. I say it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make you say it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Denis. But you must do it another time. I must go in and get
      my ankle into hot water. It&rsquo;s beginning to swell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reasons of health could not be gainsaid. Denis got up reluctantly, and
      helped his companion to her feet. She took a cautious step. &ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; She
      halted and leaned heavily on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry you,&rdquo; Denis offered. He had never tried to carry a woman, but
      on the cinema it always looked an easy piece of heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can.&rdquo; He felt larger and more protective than ever. &ldquo;Put your
      arms round my neck,&rdquo; he ordered. She did so and, stooping, he picked her
      up under the knees and lifted her from the ground. Good heavens, what a
      weight! He took five staggering steps up the slope, then almost lost his
      equilibrium, and had to deposit his burden suddenly, with something of a
      bump.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was shaking with laughter. &ldquo;I said you couldn&rsquo;t, my poor Denis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Denis, without conviction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly sweet of you to offer, but I&rsquo;d rather walk, thanks.&rdquo; She
      laid her hand on his shoulder and, thus supported, began to limp slowly up
      the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Denis!&rdquo; she repeated, and laughed again. Humiliated, he was
      silent. It seemed incredible that, only two minutes ago, he should have
      been holding her in his embrace, kissing her. Incredible. She was helpless
      then, a child. Now she had regained all her superiority; she was once more
      the far-off being, desired and unassailable. Why had he been such a fool
      as to suggest that carrying stunt? He reached the house in a state of the
      profoundest depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped Anne upstairs, left her in the hands of a maid, and came down
      again to the drawing-room. He was surprised to find them all sitting just
      where he had left them. He had expected that, somehow, everything would be
      quite different&mdash;it seemed such a prodigious time since he went away.
      All silent and all damned, he reflected, as he looked at them. Mr.
      Scogan&rsquo;s pipe still wheezed; that was the only sound. Henry Wimbush was
      still deep in his account books; he had just made the discovery that Sir
      Ferdinando was in the habit of eating oysters the whole summer through,
      regardless of the absence of the justifying R. Gombauld, in horn-rimmed
      spectacles, was reading. Jenny was mysteriously scribbling in her red
      notebook. And, seated in her favourite arm-chair at the corner of the
      hearth, Priscilla was looking through a pile of drawings. One by one she
      held them out at arm&rsquo;s length and, throwing back her mountainous orange
      head, looked long and attentively through half-closed eyelids. She wore a
      pale sea-green dress; on the slope of her mauve-powdered decolletage
      diamonds twinkled. An immensely long cigarette-holder projected at an
      angle from her face. Diamonds were embedded in her high-piled coiffure;
      they glittered every time she moved. It was a batch of Ivor&rsquo;s drawings&mdash;sketches
      of Spirit Life, made in the course of tranced tours through the other
      world. On the back of each sheet descriptive titles were written:
      &ldquo;Portrait of an Angel, 15th March &lsquo;20;&rdquo; &ldquo;Astral Beings at Play, 3rd
      December &lsquo;19;&rdquo; &ldquo;A Party of Souls on their Way to a Higher Sphere, 21st May
      &lsquo;21.&rdquo; Before examining the drawing on the obverse of each sheet, she
      turned it over to read the title. Try as she could&mdash;and she tried
      hard&mdash;Priscilla had never seen a vision or succeeded in establishing
      any communication with the Spirit World. She had to be content with the
      reported experiences of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with the rest of your party?&rdquo; she asked, looking up as
      Denis entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained. Anne had gone to bed, Ivor and Mary were still in the
      garden. He selected a book and a comfortable chair, and tried, as far as
      the disturbed state of his mind would permit him, to compose himself for
      an evening&rsquo;s reading. The lamplight was utterly serene; there was no
      movement save the stir of Priscilla among her papers. All silent and all
      damned, Denis repeated to himself, all silent and all damned...
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly an hour later when Ivor and Mary made their appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We waited to see the moon rise,&rdquo; said Ivor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was gibbous, you know,&rdquo; Mary explained, very technical and scientific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so beautiful down in the garden! The trees, the scent of the
      flowers, the stars...&rdquo; Ivor waved his arms. &ldquo;And when the moon came up, it
      was really too much. It made me burst into tears.&rdquo; He sat down at the
      piano and opened the lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were a great many meteorites,&rdquo; said Mary to anyone who would
      listen. &ldquo;The earth must just be coming into the summer shower of them. In
      July and August...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ivor had already begun to strike the keys. He played the garden, the
      stars, the scent of flowers, the rising moon. He even put in a nightingale
      that was not there. Mary looked on and listened with parted lips. The
      others pursued their occupations, without appearing to be seriously
      disturbed. On this very July day, exactly three hundred and fifty years
      ago, Sir Ferdinando had eaten seven dozen oysters. The discovery of this
      fact gave Henry Wimbush a peculiar pleasure. He had a natural piety which
      made him delight in the celebration of memorial feasts. The three hundred
      and fiftieth anniversary of the seven dozen oysters...He wished he had
      known before dinner; he would have ordered champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her way to bed Mary paid a call. The light was out in Anne&rsquo;s room, but
      she was not yet asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come down to the garden with us?&rdquo; Mary asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fell down and twisted my ankle. Denis helped me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was full of sympathy. Inwardly, too, she was relieved to find Anne&rsquo;s
      non-appearance so simply accounted for. She had been vaguely suspicious,
      down there in the garden&mdash;suspicious of what, she hardly knew; but
      there had seemed to be something a little louche in the way she had
      suddenly found herself alone with Ivor. Not that she minded, of course;
      far from it. But she didn&rsquo;t like the idea that perhaps she was the victim
      of a put-up job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope you&rsquo;ll be better to-morrow,&rdquo; she said, and she commiserated
      with Anne on all she had missed&mdash;the garden, the stars, the scent of
      flowers, the meteorites through whose summer shower the earth was now
      passing, the rising moon and its gibbosity. And then they had had such
      interesting conversation. What about? About almost everything. Nature,
      art, science, poetry, the stars, spiritualism, the relations of the sexes,
      music, religion. Ivor, she thought, had an interesting mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young ladies parted affectionately.

      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he nearest Roman
      Catholic church was upwards of twenty miles away. Ivor, who was
      punctilious in his devotions, came down early to breakfast and had his car
      at the door, ready to start, by a quarter to ten. It was a smart,
      expensive-looking machine, enamelled a pure lemon yellow and upholstered
      in emerald green leather. There were two seats&mdash;three if you squeezed
      tightly enough&mdash;and their occupants were protected from wind, dust,
      and weather by a glazed sedan that rose, an elegant eighteenth-century
      hump, from the midst of the body of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had never been to a Roman Catholic service, thought it would be an
      interesting experience, and, when the car moved off through the great
      gates of the courtyard, she was occupying the spare seat in the sedan. The
      sea-lion horn roared, faintlier, faintlier, and they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the parish church of Crome Mr. Bodiham preached on 1 Kings vi. 18: &ldquo;And
      the cedar of the house within was carved with knops&rdquo;&mdash;a sermon of
      immediately local interest. For the past two years the problem of the War
      Memorial had exercised the minds of all those in Crome who had enough
      leisure, or mental energy, or party spirit to think of such things. Henry
      Wimbush was all for a library&mdash;a library of local literature, stocked
      with county histories, old maps of the district, monographs on the local
      antiquities, dialect dictionaries, handbooks of the local geology and
      natural history. He liked to think of the villagers, inspired by such
      reading, making up parties of a Sunday afternoon to look for fossils and
      flint arrow-heads. The villagers themselves favoured the idea of a
      memorial reservoir and water supply. But the busiest and most articulate
      party followed Mr. Bodiham in demanding something religious in character&mdash;a
      second lich-gate, for example, a stained-glass window, a monument of
      marble, or, if possible, all three. So far, however, nothing had been
      done, partly because the memorial committee had never been able to agree,
      partly for the more cogent reason that too little money had been
      subscribed to carry out any of the proposed schemes. Every three or four
      months Mr. Bodiham preached a sermon on the subject. His last had been
      delivered in March; it was high time that his congregation had a fresh
      reminder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bodiham touched lightly on Solomon&rsquo;s temple. From thence he passed to
      temples and churches in general. What were the characteristics of these
      buildings dedicated to God? Obviously, the fact of their, from a human
      point of view, complete uselessness. They were unpractical buildings
      &ldquo;carved with knops.&rdquo; Solomon might have built a library&mdash;indeed, what
      could be more to the taste of the world&rsquo;s wisest man? He might have dug a
      reservoir&mdash;what more useful in a parched city like Jerusalem? He did
      neither; he built a house all carved with knops, useless and unpractical.
      Why? Because he was dedicating the work to God. There had been much talk
      in Crome about the proposed War Memorial. A War Memorial was, in its very
      nature, a work dedicated to God. It was a token of thankfulness that the
      first stage in the culminating world-war had been crowned by the triumph
      of righteousness; it was at the same time a visibly embodied supplication
      that God might not long delay the Advent which alone could bring the final
      peace. A library, a reservoir? Mr. Bodiham scornfully and indignantly
      condemned the idea. These were works dedicated to man, not to God. As a
      War Memorial they were totally unsuitable. A lich-gate had been suggested.
      This was an object which answered perfectly to the definition of a War
      Memorial: a useless work dedicated to God and carved with knops. One
      lich-gate, it was true, already existed. But nothing would be easier than
      to make a second entrance into the churchyard; and a second entrance would
      need a second gate. Other suggestions had been made. Stained-glass
      windows, a monument of marble. Both these were admirable, especially the
      latter. It was high time that the War Memorial was erected. It might soon
      be too late. At any moment, like a thief in the night, God might come.
      Meanwhile a difficulty stood in the way. Funds were inadequate. All should
      subscribe according to their means. Those who had lost relations in the
      war might reasonably be expected to subscribe a sum equal to that which
      they would have had to pay in funeral expenses if the relative had died
      while at home. Further delay was disastrous. The War Memorial must be
      built at once. He appealed to the patriotism and the Christian sentiments
      of all his hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Wimbush walked home thinking of the books he would present to the
      War Memorial Library, if ever it came into existence. He took the path
      through the fields; it was pleasanter than the road. At the first stile a
      group of village boys, loutish young fellows all dressed in the hideous
      ill-fitting black which makes a funeral of every English Sunday and
      holiday, were assembled, drearily guffawing as they smoked their
      cigarettes. They made way for Henry Wimbush, touching their caps as he
      passed. He returned their salute; his bowler and face were one in their
      unruffled gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sir Ferdinando&rsquo;s time, he reflected, in the time of his son, Sir
      Julius, these young men would have had their Sunday diversions even at
      Crome, remote and rustic Crome. There would have been archery, skittles,
      dancing&mdash;social amusements in which they would have partaken as
      members of a conscious community. Now they had nothing, nothing except Mr.
      Bodiham&rsquo;s forbidding Boys&rsquo; Club and the rare dances and concerts organised
      by himself. Boredom or the urban pleasures of the county metropolis were
      the alternatives that presented themselves to these poor youths. Country
      pleasures were no more; they had been stamped out by the Puritans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Manningham&rsquo;s Diary for 1600 there was a queer passage, he remembered, a
      very queer passage. Certain magistrates in Berkshire, Puritan magistrates,
      had had wind of a scandal. One moonlit summer night they had ridden out
      with their posse and there, among the hills, they had come upon a company
      of men and women, dancing, stark naked, among the sheepcotes. The
      magistrates and their men had ridden their horses into the crowd. How
      self-conscious the poor people must suddenly have felt, how helpless
      without their clothes against armed and booted horsemen! The dancers were
      arrested, whipped, gaoled, set in the stocks; the moonlight dance is never
      danced again. What old, earthy, Panic rite came to extinction here? he
      wondered. Who knows?&mdash;perhaps their ancestors had danced like this in
      the moonlight ages before Adam and Eve were so much as thought of. He
      liked to think so. And now it was no more. These weary young men, if they
      wanted to dance, would have to bicycle six miles to the town. The country
      was desolate, without life of its own, without indigenous pleasures. The
      pious magistrates had snuffed out for ever a little happy flame that had
      burned from the beginning of time.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>enry Wimbush&rsquo;s
      long cigar burned aromatically. The &ldquo;History of Crome&rdquo; lay on his knee;
      slowly he turned over the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide what episode to read you to-night,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;Sir Ferdinando&rsquo;s voyages are not without interest. Then, of course,
      there&rsquo;s his son, Sir Julius. It was he who suffered from the delusion that
      his perspiration engendered flies; it drove him finally to suicide. Or
      there&rsquo;s Sir Cyprian.&rdquo; He turned the pages more rapidly. &ldquo;Or Sir Henry. Or
      Sir George...No, I&rsquo;m inclined to think I won&rsquo;t read about any of these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must read something,&rdquo; insisted Mr. Scogan, taking his pipe out of
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall read about my grandfather,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush, &ldquo;and the
      events that led up to his marriage with the eldest daughter of the last
      Sir Ferdinando.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;We are listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I begin reading,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush, looking up from the book and
      taking off the pince-nez which he had just fitted to his nose&mdash;&ldquo;before
      I begin, I must say a few preliminary words about Sir Ferdinando, the last
      of the Lapiths. At the death of the virtuous and unfortunate Sir Hercules,
      Ferdinando found himself in possession of the family fortune, not a little
      increased by his father&rsquo;s temperance and thrift; he applied himself
      forthwith to the task of spending it, which he did in an ample and jovial
      fashion. By the time he was forty he had eaten and, above all, drunk and
      loved away about half his capital, and would infallibly have soon got rid
      of the rest in the same manner, if he had not had the good fortune to
      become so madly enamoured of the Rector&rsquo;s daughter as to make a proposal
      of marriage. The young lady accepted him, and in less than a year had
      become the absolute mistress of Crome and her husband. An extraordinary
      reformation made itself apparent in Sir Ferdinando&rsquo;s character. He grew
      regular and economical in his habits; he even became temperate, rarely
      drinking more than a bottle and a half of port at a sitting. The waning
      fortune of the Lapiths began once more to wax, and that in despite of the
      hard times (for Sir Ferdinando married in 1809 in the height of the
      Napoleonic Wars). A prosperous and dignified old age, cheered by the
      spectacle of his children&rsquo;s growth and happiness&mdash;for Lady Lapith had
      already borne him three daughters, and there seemed no good reason why she
      should not bear many more of them, and sons as well&mdash;a patriarchal
      decline into the family vault, seemed now to be Sir Ferdinando&rsquo;s enviable
      destiny. But Providence willed otherwise. To Napoleon, cause already of
      such infinite mischief, was due, though perhaps indirectly, the untimely
      and violent death which put a period to this reformed existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Ferdinando, who was above all things a patriot, had adopted, from the
      earliest days of the conflict with the French, his own peculiar method of
      celebrating our victories. When the happy news reached London, it was his
      custom to purchase immediately a large store of liquor and, taking a place
      on whichever of the outgoing coaches he happened to light on first, to
      drive through the country proclaiming the good news to all he met on the
      road and dispensing it, along with the liquor, at every stopping-place to
      all who cared to listen or drink. Thus, after the Nile, he had driven as
      far as Edinburgh; and later, when the coaches, wreathed with laurel for
      triumph, with cypress for mourning, were setting out with the news of
      Nelson&rsquo;s victory and death, he sat through all a chilly October night on
      the box of the Norwich &lsquo;Meteor&rsquo; with a nautical keg of rum on his knees
      and two cases of old brandy under the seat. This genial custom was one of
      the many habits which he abandoned on his marriage. The victories in the
      Peninsula, the retreat from Moscow, Leipzig, and the abdication of the
      tyrant all went uncelebrated. It so happened, however, that in the summer
      of 1815 Sir Ferdinando was staying for a few weeks in the capital. There
      had been a succession of anxious, doubtful days; then came the glorious
      news of Waterloo. It was too much for Sir Ferdinando; his joyous youth
      awoke again within him. He hurried to his wine merchant and bought a dozen
      bottles of 1760 brandy. The Bath coach was on the point of starting; he
      bribed his way on to the box and, seated in glory beside the driver,
      proclaimed aloud the downfall of the Corsican bandit and passed about the
      warm liquid joy. They clattered through Uxbridge, Slough, Maidenhead.
      Sleeping Reading was awakened by the great news. At Didcot one of the
      ostlers was so much overcome by patriotic emotions and the 1760 brandy
      that he found it impossible to do up the buckles of the harness. The night
      began to grow chilly, and Sir Ferdinando found that it was not enough to
      take a nip at every stage: to keep up his vital warmth he was compelled to
      drink between the stages as well. They were approaching Swindon. The coach
      was travelling at a dizzy speed&mdash;six miles in the last half-hour&mdash;when,
      without having manifested the slightest premonitory symptom of
      unsteadiness, Sir Ferdinando suddenly toppled sideways off his seat and
      fell, head foremost, into the road. An unpleasant jolt awakened the
      slumbering passengers. The coach was brought to a standstill; the guard
      ran back with a light. He found Sir Ferdinando still alive, but
      unconscious; blood was oozing from his mouth. The back wheels of the coach
      had passed over his body, breaking most of his ribs and both arms. His
      skull was fractured in two places. They picked him up, but he was dead
      before they reached the next stage. So perished Sir Ferdinando, a victim
      to his own patriotism. Lady Lapith did not marry again, but determined to
      devote the rest of her life to the well-being of her three children&mdash;Georgiana,
      now five years old, and Emmeline and Caroline, twins of two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Wimbush paused, and once more put on his pince-nez. &ldquo;So much by way
      of introduction,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I can begin to read about my grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, &ldquo;till I&rsquo;ve refilled my pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wimbush waited. Seated apart in a corner of the room, Ivor was showing
      Mary his sketches of Spirit Life. They spoke together in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan had lighted his pipe again. &ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Wimbush fired away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the spring of 1833 that my grandfather, George Wimbush, first
      made the acquaintance of the &lsquo;three lovely Lapiths,&rsquo; as they were always
      called. He was then a young man of twenty-two, with curly yellow hair and
      a smooth pink face that was the mirror of his youthful and ingenuous mind.
      He had been educated at Harrow and Christ Church, he enjoyed hunting and
      all other field sports, and, though his circumstances were comfortable to
      the verge of affluence, his pleasures were temperate and innocent. His
      father, an East Indian merchant, had destined him for a political career,
      and had gone to considerable expense in acquiring a pleasant little
      Cornish borough as a twenty-first birthday gift for his son. He was justly
      indignant when, on the very eve of George&rsquo;s majority, the Reform Bill of
      1832 swept the borough out of existence. The inauguration of George&rsquo;s
      political career had to be postponed. At the time he got to know the
      lovely Lapiths he was waiting; he was not at all impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lovely Lapiths did not fail to impress him. Georgiana, the eldest,
      with her black ringlets, her flashing eyes, her noble aquiline profile,
      her swan-like neck, and sloping shoulders, was orientally dazzling; and
      the twins, with their delicately turned-up noses, their blue eyes, and
      chestnut hair, were an identical pair of ravishingly English charmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their conversation at this first meeting proved, however, to be so
      forbidding that, but for the invincible attraction exercised by their
      beauty, George would never have had the courage to follow up the
      acquaintance. The twins, looking up their noses at him with an air of
      languid superiority, asked him what he thought of the latest French poetry
      and whether he liked the &lsquo;Indiana&rsquo; of George Sand. But what was almost
      worse was the question with which Georgiana opened her conversation with
      him. &lsquo;In music,&rsquo; she asked, leaning forward and fixing him with her large
      dark eyes, &lsquo;are you a classicist or a transcendentalist?&rsquo; George did not
      lose his presence of mind. He had enough appreciation of music to know
      that he hated anything classical, and so, with a promptitude which did him
      credit, he replied, &lsquo;I am a transcendentalist.&rsquo; Georgiana smiled
      bewitchingly. &lsquo;I am glad,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;so am I. You went to hear Paganini
      last week, of course. &ldquo;The prayer of Moses&rdquo;&mdash;ah!&rsquo; She closed her
      eyes. &lsquo;Do you know anything more transcendental than that?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said
      George, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; He hesitated, was about to go on speaking, and then
      decided that after all it would be wiser not to say&mdash;what was in fact
      true&mdash;that he had enjoyed above all Paganini&rsquo;s Farmyard Imitations.
      The man had made his fiddle bray like an ass, cluck like a hen, grunt,
      squeal, bark, neigh, quack, bellow, and growl; that last item, in George&rsquo;s
      estimation, had almost compensated for the tediousness of the rest of the
      concert. He smiled with pleasure at the thought of it. Yes, decidedly, he
      was no classicist in music; he was a thoroughgoing transcendentalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George followed up this first introduction by paying a call on the young
      ladies and their mother, who occupied, during the season, a small but
      elegant house in the neighbourhood of Berkeley Square. Lady Lapith made a
      few discreet inquiries, and having found that George&rsquo;s financial position,
      character, and family were all passably good, she asked him to dine. She
      hoped and expected that her daughters would all marry into the peerage;
      but, being a prudent woman, she knew it was advisable to prepare for all
      contingencies. George Wimbush, she thought, would make an excellent second
      string for one of the twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this first dinner, George&rsquo;s partner was Emmeline. They talked of
      Nature. Emmeline protested that to her high mountains were a feeling and
      the hum of human cities torture. George agreed that the country was very
      agreeable, but held that London during the season also had its charms. He
      noticed with surprise and a certain solicitous distress that Miss
      Emmeline&rsquo;s appetite was poor, that it didn&rsquo;t, in fact, exist. Two
      spoonfuls of soup, a morsel of fish, no bird, no meat, and three grapes&mdash;that
      was her whole dinner. He looked from time to time at her two sisters;
      Georgiana and Caroline seemed to be quite as abstemious. They waved away
      whatever was offered them with an expression of delicate disgust, shutting
      their eyes and averting their faces from the proffered dish, as though the
      lemon sole, the duck, the loin of veal, the trifle, were objects revolting
      to the sight and smell. George, who thought the dinner capital, ventured
      to comment on the sisters&rsquo; lack of appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t talk to me of eating,&rsquo; said Emmeline, drooping like a
      sensitive plant. &lsquo;We find it so coarse, so unspiritual, my sisters and I.
      One can&rsquo;t think of one&rsquo;s soul while one is eating.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George agreed; one couldn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;But one must live,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; Emmeline sighed. &lsquo;One must. Death is very beautiful, don&rsquo;t you
      think?&rsquo; She broke a corner off a piece of toast and began to nibble at it
      languidly. &lsquo;But since, as you say, one must live...&rsquo; She made a little
      gesture of resignation. &lsquo;Luckily a very little suffices to keep one
      alive.&rsquo; She put down her corner of toast half eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George regarded her with some surprise. She was pale, but she looked
      extraordinarily healthy, he thought; so did her sisters. Perhaps if you
      were really spiritual you needed less food. He, clearly, was not
      spiritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this he saw them frequently. They all liked him, from Lady Lapith
      downwards. True, he was not very romantic or poetical; but he was such a
      pleasant, unpretentious, kind-hearted young man, that one couldn&rsquo;t help
      liking him. For his part, he thought them wonderful, wonderful, especially
      Georgiana. He enveloped them all in a warm, protective affection. For they
      needed protection; they were altogether too frail, too spiritual for this
      world. They never ate, they were always pale, they often complained of
      fever, they talked much and lovingly of death, they frequently swooned.
      Georgiana was the most ethereal of all; of the three she ate least,
      swooned most often, talked most of death, and was the palest&mdash;with a
      pallor that was so startling as to appear positively artificial. At any
      moment, it seemed, she might loose her precarious hold on this material
      world and become all spirit. To George the thought was a continual agony.
      If she were to die...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She contrived, however, to live through the season, and that in spite of
      the numerous balls, routs, and other parties of pleasure which, in company
      with the rest of the lovely trio, she never failed to attend. In the
      middle of July the whole household moved down to the country. George was
      invited to spend the month of August at Crome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house-party was distinguished; in the list of visitors figured the
      names of two marriageable young men of title. George had hoped that
      country air, repose, and natural surroundings might have restored to the
      three sisters their appetites and the roses of their cheeks. He was
      mistaken. For dinner, the first evening, Georgiana ate only an olive, two
      or three salted almonds, and half a peach. She was as pale as ever. During
      the meal she spoke of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;True love,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;being infinite and eternal, can only be
      consummated in eternity. Indiana and Sir Rodolphe celebrated the mystic
      wedding of their souls by jumping into Niagara. Love is incompatible with
      life. The wish of two people who truly love one another is not to live
      together but to die together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, come, my dear,&rsquo; said Lady Lapith, stout and practical. &lsquo;What would
      become of the next generation, pray, if all the world acted on your
      principles?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mamma!...&rsquo; Georgiana protested, and dropped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In my young days,&rsquo; Lady Lapith went on, &lsquo;I should have been laughed out
      of countenance if I&rsquo;d said a thing like that. But then in my young days
      souls weren&rsquo;t as fashionable as they are now and we didn&rsquo;t think death was
      at all poetical. It was just unpleasant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mamma!...&rsquo; Emmeline and Caroline implored in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In my young days&mdash;&rsquo; Lady Lapith was launched into her subject;
      nothing, it seemed, could stop her now. &lsquo;In my young days, if you didn&rsquo;t
      eat, people told you you needed a dose of rhubarb. Nowadays...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a cry; Georgiana had swooned sideways on to Lord Timpany&rsquo;s
      shoulder. It was a desperate expedient; but it was successful. Lady Lapith
      was stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The days passed in an uneventful round of pleasures. Of all the gay party
      George alone was unhappy. Lord Timpany was paying his court to Georgiana,
      and it was clear that he was not unfavourably received. George looked on,
      and his soul was a hell of jealousy and despair. The boisterous company of
      the young men became intolerable to him; he shrank from them, seeking
      gloom and solitude. One morning, having broken away from them on some
      vague pretext, he returned to the house alone. The young men were bathing
      in the pool below; their cries and laughter floated up to him, making the
      quiet house seem lonelier and more silent. The lovely sisters and their
      mamma still kept their chambers; they did not customarily make their
      appearance till luncheon, so that the male guests had the morning to
      themselves. George sat down in the hall and abandoned himself to thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any moment she might die; at any moment she might become Lady Timpany.
      It was terrible, terrible. If she died, then he would die too; he would go
      to seek her beyond the grave. If she became Lady Timpany...ah, then! The
      solution of the problem would not be so simple. If she became Lady
      Timpany: it was a horrible thought. But then suppose she were in love with
      Timpany&mdash;though it seemed incredible that anyone could be in love
      with Timpany&mdash;suppose her life depended on Timpany, suppose she
      couldn&rsquo;t live without him? He was fumbling his way along this clueless
      labyrinth of suppositions when the clock struck twelve. On the last
      stroke, like an automaton released by the turning clockwork, a little
      maid, holding a large covered tray, popped out of the door that led from
      the kitchen regions into the hall. From his deep arm-chair George watched
      her (himself, it was evident, unobserved) with an idle curiosity. She
      pattered across the room and came to a halt in front of what seemed a
      blank expense of panelling. She reached out her hand and, to George&rsquo;s
      extreme astonishment, a little door swung open, revealing the foot of a
      winding staircase. Turning sideways in order to get her tray through the
      narrow opening, the little maid darted in with a rapid crab-like motion.
      The door closed behind her with a click. A minute later it opened again
      and the maid, without her tray, hurried back across the hall and
      disappeared in the direction of the kitchen. George tried to recompose his
      thoughts, but an invincible curiosity drew his mind towards the hidden
      door, the staircase, the little maid. It was in vain he told himself that
      the matter was none of his business, that to explore the secrets of that
      surprising door, that mysterious staircase within, would be a piece of
      unforgivable rudeness and indiscretion. It was in vain; for five minutes
      he struggled heroically with his curiosity, but at the end of that time he
      found himself standing in front of the innocent sheet of panelling through
      which the little maid had disappeared. A glance sufficed to show him the
      position of the secret door&mdash;secret, he perceived, only to those who
      looked with a careless eye. It was just an ordinary door let in flush with
      the panelling. No latch nor handle betrayed its position, but an
      unobtrusive catch sunk in the wood invited the thumb. George was
      astonished that he had not noticed it before; now he had seen it, it was
      so obvious, almost as obvious as the cupboard door in the library with its
      lines of imitation shelves and its dummy books. He pulled back the catch
      and peeped inside. The staircase, of which the degrees were made not of
      stone but of blocks of ancient oak, wound up and out of sight. A slit-like
      window admitted the daylight; he was at the foot of the central tower, and
      the little window looked out over the terrace; they were still shouting
      and splashing in the pool below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George closed the door and went back to his seat. But his curiosity was
      not satisfied. Indeed, this partial satisfaction had but whetted its
      appetite. Where did the staircase lead? What was the errand of the little
      maid? It was no business of his, he kept repeating&mdash;no business of
      his. He tried to read, but his attention wandered. A quarter-past twelve
      sounded on the harmonious clock. Suddenly determined, George rose, crossed
      the room, opened the hidden door, and began to ascend the stairs. He
      passed the first window, corkscrewed round, and came to another. He paused
      for a moment to look out; his heart beat uncomfortably, as though he were
      affronting some unknown danger. What he was doing, he told himself, was
      extremely ungentlemanly, horribly underbred. He tiptoed onward and upward.
      One turn more, then half a turn, and a door confronted him. He halted
      before it, listened; he could hear no sound. Putting his eye to the
      keyhole, he saw nothing but a stretch of white sunlit wall. Emboldened, he
      turned the handle and stepped across the threshold. There he halted,
      petrified by what he saw, mutely gaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the middle of a pleasantly sunny little room&mdash;&lsquo;it is now
      Priscilla&rsquo;s boudoir,&rsquo; Mr. Wimbush remarked parenthetically&mdash;stood a
      small circular table of mahogany. Crystal, porcelain, and silver,&mdash;all
      the shining apparatus of an elegant meal&mdash;were mirrored in its
      polished depths. The carcase of a cold chicken, a bowl of fruit, a great
      ham, deeply gashed to its heart of tenderest white and pink, the brown
      cannon ball of a cold plum-pudding, a slender Hock bottle, and a decanter
      of claret jostled one another for a place on this festive board. And round
      the table sat the three sisters, the three lovely Lapiths&mdash;eating!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At George&rsquo;s sudden entrance they had all looked towards the door, and now
      they sat, petrified by the same astonishment which kept George fixed and
      staring. Georgiana, who sat immediately facing the door, gazed at him with
      dark, enormous eyes. Between the thumb and forefinger of her right hand
      she was holding a drumstick of the dismembered chicken; her little finger,
      elegantly crooked, stood apart from the rest of her hand. Her mouth was
      open, but the drumstick had never reached its destination; it remained,
      suspended, frozen, in mid-air. The other two sisters had turned round to
      look at the intruder. Caroline still grasped her knife and fork;
      Emmeline&rsquo;s fingers were round the stem of her claret glass. For what
      seemed a very long time, George and the three sisters stared at one
      another in silence. They were a group of statues. Then suddenly there was
      movement. Georgiana dropped her chicken bone, Caroline&rsquo;s knife and fork
      clattered on her plate. The movement propagated itself, grew more
      decisive; Emmeline sprang to her feet, uttering a cry. The wave of panic
      reached George; he turned and, mumbling something unintelligible as he
      went, rushed out of the room and down the winding stairs. He came to a
      standstill in the hall, and there, all by himself in the quiet house, he
      began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At luncheon it was noticed that the sisters ate a little more than usual.
      Georgiana toyed with some French beans and a spoonful of calves&rsquo;-foot
      jelly. &lsquo;I feel a little stronger to-day,&rsquo; she said to Lord Timpany, when
      he congratulated her on this increase of appetite; &lsquo;a little more
      material,&rsquo; she added, with a nervous laugh. Looking up, she caught
      George&rsquo;s eye; a blush suffused her cheeks and she looked hastily away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the garden that afternoon they found themselves for a moment alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell anyone, George? Promise you won&rsquo;t tell anyone,&rsquo; she
      implored. &lsquo;It would make us look so ridiculous. And besides, eating IS
      unspiritual, isn&rsquo;t it? Say you won&rsquo;t tell anyone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said George brutally. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell everyone, unless...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s blackmail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care, said George. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you twenty-four hours to decide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lapith was disappointed, of course; she had hoped for better things&mdash;for
      Timpany and a coronet. But George, after all, wasn&rsquo;t so bad. They were
      married at the New Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor grandfather!&rdquo; Mr. Wimbush added, as he closed his book and put
      away his pince-nez. &ldquo;Whenever I read in the papers about oppressed
      nationalities, I think of him.&rdquo; He relighted his cigar. &ldquo;It was a maternal
      government, highly centralised, and there were no representative
      institutions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Wimbush ceased speaking. In the silence that ensued Ivor&rsquo;s whispered
      commentary on the spirit sketches once more became audible. Priscilla, who
      had been dozing, suddenly woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said in the startled tones of one newly returned to
      consciousness; &ldquo;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny caught the words. She looked up, smiled, nodded reassuringly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      about a ham,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s about a ham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Henry has been reading.&rdquo; She closed the red notebook lying on her
      knees and slipped a rubber band round it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rdquo; she
      announced, and got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Anne, yawning. But she lacked the energy to rise from her
      arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was hot and oppressive. Round the open windows the curtains hung
      unmoving. Ivor, fanning himself with the portrait of an Astral Being,
      looked out into the darkness and drew a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The air&rsquo;s like wool,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will get cooler after midnight,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush, and cautiously
      added, &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t sleep, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Priscilla turned her head in his direction; the monumental coiffure nodded
      exorbitantly at her slightest movement. &ldquo;You must make an effort,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;When I can&rsquo;t sleep, I concentrate my will: I say, &lsquo;I will sleep, I
      am asleep!&rsquo; And pop! off I go. That&rsquo;s the power of thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does it work on stuffy nights?&rdquo; Ivor inquired. &ldquo;I simply cannot sleep
      on a stuffy night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can I,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;except out of doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of doors! What a wonderful idea!&rdquo; In the end they decided to sleep on
      the towers&mdash;Mary on the western tower, Ivor on the eastern. There was
      a flat expanse of leads on each of the towers, and you could get a
      mattress through the trap doors that opened on to them. Under the stars,
      under the gibbous moon, assuredly they would sleep. The mattresses were
      hauled up, sheets and blankets were spread, and an hour later the two
      insomniasts, each on his separate tower, were crying their good-nights
      across the dividing gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mary the sleep-compelling charm of the open air did not work with its
      expected magic. Even through the mattress one could not fail to be aware
      that the leads were extremely hard. Then there were noises: the owls
      screeched tirelessly, and once, roused by some unknown terror, all the
      geese of the farmyard burst into a sudden frenzy of cackling. The stars
      and the gibbous moon demanded to be looked at, and when one meteorite had
      streaked across the sky, you could not help waiting, open-eyed and alert,
      for the next. Time passed; the moon climbed higher and higher in the sky.
      Mary felt less sleepy than she had when she first came out. She sat up and
      looked over the parapet. Had Ivor been able to sleep? she wondered. And as
      though in answer to her mental question, from behind the chimney-stack at
      the farther end of the roof a white form noiselessly emerged&mdash;a form
      that, in the moonlight, was recognisably Ivor&rsquo;s. Spreading his arms to
      right and left, like a tight-rope dancer, he began to walk forward along
      the roof-tree of the house. He swayed terrifyingly as he advanced. Mary
      looked on speechlessly; perhaps he was walking in his sleep! Suppose he
      were to wake up suddenly, now! If she spoke or moved it might mean his
      death. She dared look no more, but sank back on her pillows. She listened
      intently. For what seemed an immensely long time there was no sound. Then
      there was a patter of feet on the tiles, followed by a scrabbling noise
      and a whispered &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; And suddenly Ivor&rsquo;s head and shoulders appeared
      above the parapet. One leg followed, then the other. He was on the leads.
      Mary pretended to wake up with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;so I came along to see if you couldn&rsquo;t.
      One gets bored by oneself on a tower. Don&rsquo;t you find it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was light before five. Long, narrow clouds barred the east, their edges
      bright with orange fire. The sky was pale and watery. With the mournful
      scream of a soul in pain, a monstrous peacock, flying heavily up from
      below, alighted on the parapet of the tower. Ivor and Mary started broad
      awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo; cried Ivor, jumping up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a feather.&rdquo; The
      frightened peacock ran up and down the parapet in an absurd distress,
      curtseying and bobbing and clucking; his long tail swung ponderously back
      and forth as he turned and turned again. Then with a flap and swish he
      launched himself upon the air and sailed magnificently earthward, with a
      recovered dignity. But he had left a trophy. Ivor had his feather, a
      long-lashed eye of purple and green, of blue and gold. He handed it to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An angel&rsquo;s feather,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked at it for a moment, gravely and intently. Her purple pyjamas
      clothed her with an ampleness that hid the lines of her body; she looked
      like some large, comfortable, unjointed toy, a sort of Teddy-bear&mdash;but
      a Teddy bear with an angel&rsquo;s head, pink cheeks, and hair like a bell of
      gold. An angel&rsquo;s face, the feather of an angel&rsquo;s wing...Somehow the whole
      atmosphere of this sunrise was rather angelic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary to think of sexual selection,&rdquo; she said at last,
      looking up from her contemplation of the miraculous feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary!&rdquo; Ivor echoed. &ldquo;I select you, you select me. What luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her shoulders and they stood looking eastward. The
      first sunlight had begun to warm and colour the pale light of the dawn.
      Mauve pyjamas and white pyjamas; they were a young and charming couple.
      The rising sun touched their faces. It was all extremely symbolic; but
      then, if you choose to think so, nothing in this world is not symbolical.
      Profound and beautiful truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be getting back to my tower,&rdquo; said Ivor at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. The varletry will soon be up and about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivor...&rdquo; There was a prolonged and silent farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Ivor, &ldquo;I repeat my tight-rope stunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary threw her arms round his neck. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t, Ivor. It&rsquo;s dangerous.
      Please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had to yield at last to her entreaties. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
      down through the house and up at the other end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He vanished through the trap door into the darkness that still lurked
      within the shuttered house. A minute later he had reappeared on the
      farther tower; he waved his hand, and then sank down, out of sight, behind
      the parapet. From below, in the house, came the thin wasp-like buzzing of
      an alarum-clock. He had gone back just in time.

      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>vor was gone.
      Lounging behind the wind-screen in his yellow sedan he was whirling across
      rural England. Social and amorous engagements of the most urgent character
      called him from hall to baronial hall, from castle to castle, from
      Elizabethan manor-house to Georgian mansion, over the whole expanse of the
      kingdom. To-day in Somerset, to-morrow in Warwickshire, on Saturday in the
      West riding, by Tuesday morning in Argyll&mdash;Ivor never rested. The
      whole summer through, from the beginning of July till the end of
      September, he devoted himself to his engagements; he was a martyr to them.
      In the autumn he went back to London for a holiday. Crome had been a
      little incident, an evanescent bubble on the stream of his life; it
      belonged already to the past. By tea-time he would be at Gobley, and there
      would be Zenobia&rsquo;s welcoming smile. And on Thursday morning&mdash;but that
      was a long, long way ahead. He would think of Thursday morning when
      Thursday morning arrived. Meanwhile there was Gobley, meanwhile Zenobia.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the visitor&rsquo;s book at Crome Ivor had left, according to his invariable
      custom in these cases, a poem. He had improvised it magisterially in the
      ten minutes preceding his departure. Denis and Mr. Scogan strolled back
      together from the gates of the courtyard, whence they had bidden their
      last farewells; on the writing-table in the hall they found the visitor&rsquo;s
      book, open, and Ivor&rsquo;s composition scarcely dry. Mr. Scogan read it aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The magic of those immemorial kings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who webbed enchantment on the bowls of night.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sleeps in the soul of all created things;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the blue sea, th&rsquo; Acroceraunian height,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the eyed butterfly&rsquo;s auricular wings
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And orgied visions of the anchorite;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In all that singing flies and flying sings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In rain, in pain, in delicate delight.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But much more magic, much more cogent spells
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Weave here their wizardries about my soul.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Crome calls me like the voice of vesperal bells,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Haunts like a ghostly-peopled necropole.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Fate tears me hence. Hard fate! since far from Crome
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      My soul must weep, remembering its Home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nice and tasteful and tactful,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, when he had
      finished. &ldquo;I am only troubled by the butterfly&rsquo;s auricular wings. You have
      a first-hand knowledge of the workings of a poet&rsquo;s mind, Denis; perhaps
      you can explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could be simpler,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful word, and Ivor
      wanted to say that the wings were golden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make it luminously clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One suffers so much,&rdquo; Denis went on, &ldquo;from the fact that beautiful words
      don&rsquo;t always mean what they ought to mean. Recently, for example, I had a
      whole poem ruined, just because the word &lsquo;carminative&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t mean what it
      ought to have meant. Carminative&mdash;it&rsquo;s admirable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan agreed. &ldquo;And what does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a word I&rsquo;ve treasured from my earliest infancy,&rdquo; said Denis,
      &ldquo;treasured and loved. They used to give me cinnamon when I had a cold&mdash;quite
      useless, but not disagreeable. One poured it drop by drop out of narrow
      bottles, a golden liquor, fierce and fiery. On the label was a list of its
      virtues, and among other things it was described as being in the highest
      degree carminative. I adored the word. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it carminative?&rsquo; I used to
      say to myself when I&rsquo;d taken my dose. It seemed so wonderfully to describe
      that sensation of internal warmth, that glow, that&mdash;what shall I call
      it?&mdash;physical self-satisfaction which followed the drinking of
      cinnamon. Later, when I discovered alcohol, &lsquo;carminative&rsquo; described for me
      that similar, but nobler, more spiritual glow which wine evokes not only
      in the body but in the soul as well. The carminative virtues of burgundy,
      of rum, of old brandy, of Lacryma Christi, of Marsala, of Aleatico, of
      stout, of gin, of champagne, of claret, of the raw new wine of this year&rsquo;s
      Tuscan vintage&mdash;I compared them, I classified them. Marsala is
      rosily, downily carminative; gin pricks and refreshes while it warms. I
      had a whole table of carmination values. And now&rdquo;&mdash;Denis spread out
      his hands, palms upwards, despairingly&mdash;&ldquo;now I know what carminative
      really means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what DOES it mean?&rdquo; asked Mr. Scogan, a little impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carminative,&rdquo; said Denis, lingering lovingly over the syllables,
      &ldquo;carminative. I imagined vaguely that it had something to do with
      carmen-carminis, still more vaguely with caro-carnis, and its derivations,
      like carnival and carnation. Carminative&mdash;there was the idea of
      singing and the idea of flesh, rose-coloured and warm, with a suggestion
      of the jollities of mi-Careme and the masked holidays of Venice.
      Carminative&mdash;the warmth, the glow, the interior ripeness were all in
      the word. Instead of which...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come to the point, my dear Denis,&rdquo; protested Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;Do come to
      the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wrote a poem the other day,&rdquo; said Denis; &ldquo;I wrote a poem about
      the effects of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others have done the same before you,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;There is no need
      to be ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was putting forward the notion,&rdquo; Denis went on, &ldquo;that the effects of
      love were often similar to the effects of wine, that Eros could intoxicate
      as well as Bacchus. Love, for example, is essentially carminative. It
      gives one the sense of warmth, the glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;<i>And passion carminative as wine</i>...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      was what I wrote. Not only was the line elegantly sonorous; it was also, I
      flattered myself, very aptly compendiously expressive. Everything was in
      the word carminative&mdash;a detailed, exact foreground, an immense,
      indefinite hinterland of suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;<i>And passion carminative as wine</i>...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not ill-pleased. And then suddenly it occurred to me that I had
      never actually looked up the word in a dictionary. Carminative had grown
      up with me from the days of the cinnamon bottle. It had always been taken
      for granted. Carminative: for me the word was as rich in content as some
      tremendous, elaborate work of art; it was a complete landscape with
      figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;<i>And passion carminative as wine</i>...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time I had ever committed the word to writing, and all at
      once I felt I would like lexicographical authority for it. A small
      English-German dictionary was all I had at hand. I turned up C, ca, car,
      carm. There it was: &lsquo;Carminative: windtreibend.&rsquo; Windtreibend!&rdquo; he
      repeated. Mr. Scogan laughed. Denis shook his head. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for me
      it was no laughing matter. For me it marked the end of a chapter, the
      death of something young and precious. There were the years&mdash;years of
      childhood and innocence&mdash;when I had believed that carminative meant&mdash;well,
      carminative. And now, before me lies the rest of my life&mdash;a day,
      perhaps, ten years, half a century, when I shall know that carminative
      means windtreibend.

      It is a realisation that makes one rather melancholy.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Carminative,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan thoughtfully.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Carminative,&rdquo; Denis repeated, and they were silent for a time. &ldquo;Words,&rdquo;
       said Denis at last, &ldquo;words&mdash;I wonder if you can realise how much I
      love them. You are too much preoccupied with mere things and ideas and
      people to understand the full beauty of words. Your mind is not a literary
      mind. The spectacle of Mr. Gladstone finding thirty-four rhymes to the
      name &lsquo;Margot&rsquo; seems to you rather pathetic than anything else. Mallarmé&rsquo;s
      envelopes with their versified addresses leave you cold, unless they leave
      you pitiful; you can&rsquo;t see that

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel it to be magical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the test for the literary mind,&rdquo; said Denis; &ldquo;the feeling of
      magic, the sense that words have power. The technical, verbal part of
      literature is simply a development of magic. Words are man&rsquo;s first and
      most grandiose invention. With language he created a whole new universe;
      what wonder if he loved words and attributed power to them! With fitted,
      harmonious words the magicians summoned rabbits out of empty hats and
      spirits from the elements. Their descendants, the literary men, still go
      on with the process, morticing their verbal formulas together, and, before
      the power of the finished spell, trembling with delight and awe. Rabbits
      out of empty hats? No, their spells are more subtly powerful, for they
      evoke emotions out of empty minds. Formulated by their art the most
      insipid statements become enormously significant. For example, I proffer
      the constatation, &lsquo;Black ladders lack bladders.&rsquo; A self-evident truth, one
      on which it would not have been worth while to insist, had I chosen to
      formulate it in such words as &lsquo;Black fire-escapes have no bladders,&rsquo; or,
      &lsquo;Les echelles noires manquent de vessie.&rsquo; But since I put it as I do,
      &lsquo;Black ladders lack bladders,&rsquo; it becomes, for all its self-evidence,
      significant, unforgettable, moving. The creation by word-power of
      something out of nothing&mdash;what is that but magic? And, I may add,
      what is that but literature? Half the world&rsquo;s greatest poetry is simply
      &lsquo;Les echelles noires manquent de vessie,&rsquo; translated into magic
      significance as, &lsquo;Black ladders lack bladders.&rsquo; And you can&rsquo;t appreciate
      words. I&rsquo;m sorry for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mental carminative,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan reflectively. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you
      need.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>erched on its four
      stone mushrooms, the little granary stood two or three feet above the
      grass of the green close. Beneath it there was a perpetual shade and a
      damp growth of long, luxuriant grasses. Here, in the shadow, in the green
      dampness, a family of white ducks had sought shelter from the afternoon
      sun. Some stood, preening themselves, some reposed with their long bellies
      pressed to the ground, as though the cool grass were water. Little social
      noises burst fitfully forth, and from time to time some pointed tail would
      execute a brilliant Lisztian tremolo. Suddenly their jovial repose was
      shattered. A prodigious thump shook the wooden flooring above their heads;
      the whole granary trembled, little fragments of dirt and crumbled wood
      rained down among them. With a loud, continuous quacking the ducks rushed
      out from beneath this nameless menace, and did not stay their flight till
      they were safely in the farmyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your temper,&rdquo; Anne was saying. &ldquo;Listen! You&rsquo;ve frightened the
      ducks. Poor dears! no wonder.&rdquo; She was sitting sideways in a low, wooden
      chair. Her right elbow rested on the back of the chair and she supported
      her cheek on her hand. Her long, slender body drooped into curves of a
      lazy grace. She was smiling, and she looked at Gombauld through
      half-closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; Gombauld repeated, and stamped his foot again. He glared at
      her round the half-finished portrait on the easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor ducks!&rdquo; Anne repeated. The sound of their quacking was faint in the
      distance; it was inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see you make me lose my time?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t work with you
      dangling about distractingly like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d lose less time if you stopped talking and stamping your feet and
      did a little painting for a change. After all, what am I dangling about
      for, except to be painted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld made a noise like a growl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awful,&rdquo; he said, with
      conviction. &ldquo;Why do you ask me to come and stay here? Why do you tell me
      you&rsquo;d like me to paint your portrait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the simple reasons that I like you&mdash;at least, when you&rsquo;re in a
      good temper&mdash;and that I think you&rsquo;re a good painter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the simple reason&rdquo;&mdash;Gombauld mimicked her voice&mdash;&ldquo;that you
      want me to make love to you and, when I do, to have the amusement of
      running away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne threw back her head and laughed. &ldquo;So you think it amuses me to have
      to evade your advances! So like a man! If you only knew how gross and
      awful and boring men are when they try to make love and you don&rsquo;t want
      them to make love! If you could only see yourselves through our eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld picked up his palette and brushes and attacked his canvas with
      the ardour of irritation. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be saying next that you didn&rsquo;t
      start the game, that it was I who made the first advances, and that you
      were the innocent victim who sat still and never did anything that could
      invite or allure me on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So like a man again!&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the same old story about
      the woman tempting the man. The woman lures, fascinates, invites; and man&mdash;noble
      man, innocent man&mdash;falls a victim. My poor Gombauld! Surely you&rsquo;re
      not going to sing that old song again. It&rsquo;s so unintelligent, and I always
      thought you were a man of sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Gombauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a little objective,&rdquo; Anne went on. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that you&rsquo;re simply
      externalising your own emotions? That&rsquo;s what you men are always doing;
      it&rsquo;s so barbarously naive. You feel one of your loose desires for some
      woman, and because you desire her strongly you immediately accuse her of
      luring you on, of deliberately provoking and inviting the desire. You have
      the mentality of savages. You might just as well say that a plate of
      strawberries and cream deliberately lures you on to feel greedy. In
      ninety-nine cases out of a hundred women are as passive and innocent as
      the strawberries and cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all I can say is that this must be the hundredth case,&rdquo; said
      Gombauld, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne shrugged her shoulders and gave vent to a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at a loss to
      know whether you&rsquo;re more silly or more rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After painting for a little time in silence Gombauld began to speak again.
      &ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s Denis,&rdquo; he said, renewing the conversation as though it
      had only just been broken off. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing the same game with him. Why
      can&rsquo;t you leave that wretched young man in peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne flushed with a sudden and uncontrollable anger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly
      untrue about Denis,&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;I never dreamt of playing what
      you beautifully call the same game with him.&rdquo; Recovering her calm, she
      added in her ordinary cooing voice and with her exacerbating smile,
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become very protective towards poor Denis all of a sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Gombauld replied, with a gravity that was somehow a little too
      solemn. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see a young man...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...being whirled along the road to ruin,&rdquo; said Anne, continuing his
      sentence for him. &ldquo;I admire your sentiments and, believe me, I share
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was curiously irritated at what Gombauld had said about Denis. It
      happened to be so completely untrue. Gombauld might have some slight
      ground for his reproaches. But Denis&mdash;no, she had never flirted with
      Denis. Poor boy! He was very sweet. She became somewhat pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld painted on with fury. The restlessness of an unsatisfied desire,
      which, before, had distracted his mind, making work impossible, seemed now
      to have converted itself into a kind of feverish energy. When it was
      finished, he told himself, the portrait would be diabolic. He was painting
      her in the pose she had naturally adopted at the first sitting. Seated
      sideways, her elbow on the back of the chair, her head and shoulders
      turned at an angle from the rest of her body, towards the front, she had
      fallen into an attitude of indolent abandonment. He had emphasised the
      lazy curves of her body; the lines sagged as they crossed the canvas, the
      grace of the painted figure seemed to be melting into a kind of soft
      decay. The hand that lay along the knee was as limp as a glove. He was at
      work on the face now; it had begun to emerge on the canvas, doll-like in
      its regularity and listlessness. It was Anne&rsquo;s face&mdash;but her face as
      it would be, utterly unillumined by the inward lights of thought and
      emotion. It was the lazy, expressionless mask which was sometimes her
      face. The portrait was terribly like; and at the same time it was the most
      malicious of lies. Yes, it would be diabolic when it was finished,
      Gombauld decided; he wondered what she would think of it.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or the sake of
      peace and quiet Denis had retired earlier on this same afternoon to his
      bedroom. He wanted to work, but the hour was a drowsy one, and lunch, so
      recently eaten, weighed heavily on body and mind. The meridian demon was
      upon him; he was possessed by that bored and hopeless post-prandial
      melancholy which the coenobites of old knew and feared under the name of
      &ldquo;accidie.&rdquo; He felt, like Ernest Dowson, &ldquo;a little weary.&rdquo; He was in the
      mood to write something rather exquisite and gentle and quietist in tone;
      something a little droopy and at the same time&mdash;how should he put it?&mdash;a
      little infinite. He thought of Anne, of love hopeless and unattainable.
      Perhaps that was the ideal kind of love, the hopeless kind&mdash;the
      quiet, theoretical kind of love. In this sad mood of repletion he could
      well believe it. He began to write. One elegant quatrain had flowed from
      beneath his pen:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;A brooding love which is at most
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The stealth of moonbeams when they slide,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Evoking colour&rsquo;s bloodless ghost,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      O&rsquo;er some scarce-breathing breast or side...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      when his attention was attracted by a sound from outside. He looked down
      from his window; there they were, Anne and Gombauld, talking, laughing
      together. They crossed the courtyard in front, and passed out of sight
      through the gate in the right-hand wall. That was the way to the green
      close and the granary; she was going to sit for him again. His pleasantly
      depressing melancholy was dissipated by a puff of violent emotion; angrily
      he threw his quatrain into the waste-paper basket and ran downstairs. &ldquo;The
      stealth of moonbeams,&rdquo; indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall he saw Mr. Scogan; the man seemed to be lying in wait. Denis
      tried to escape, but in vain. Mr. Scogan&rsquo;s eye glittered like the eye of
      the Ancient Mariner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; he said, stretching out a small saurian hand with pointed
      nails&mdash;&ldquo;not so fast. I was just going down to the flower garden to
      take the sun. We&rsquo;ll go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis abandoned himself; Mr. Scogan put on his hat and they went out arm
      in arm. On the shaven turf of the terrace Henry Wimbush and Mary were
      playing a solemn game of bowls. They descended by the yew-tree walk. It
      was here, thought Denis, here that Anne had fallen, here that he had
      kissed her, here&mdash;and he blushed with retrospective shame at the
      memory&mdash;here that he had tried to carry her and failed. Life was
      awful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanity!&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, suddenly breaking a long silence. &ldquo;Sanity&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what&rsquo;s wrong with me and that&rsquo;s what will be wrong with you, my dear
      Denis, when you&rsquo;re old enough to be sane or insane. In a sane world I
      should be a great man; as things are, in this curious establishment, I am
      nothing at all; to all intents and purposes I don&rsquo;t exist. I am just Vox
      et praeterea nihil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis made no response; he was thinking of other things. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he
      said to himself&mdash;&ldquo;after all, Gombauld is better looking than I, more
      entertaining, more confident; and, besides, he&rsquo;s already somebody and I&rsquo;m
      still only potential...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything that ever gets done in this world is done by madmen,&rdquo; Mr.
      Scogan went on. Denis tried not to listen, but the tireless insistence of
      Mr. Scogan&rsquo;s discourse gradually compelled his attention. &ldquo;Men such as I
      am, such as you may possibly become, have never achieved anything. We&rsquo;re
      too sane; we&rsquo;re merely reasonable. We lack the human touch, the compelling
      enthusiastic mania. People are quite ready to listen to the philosophers
      for a little amusement, just as they would listen to a fiddler or a
      mountebank. But as to acting on the advice of the men of reason&mdash;never.
      Wherever the choice has had to be made between the man of reason and the
      madman, the world has unhesitatingly followed the madman. For the madman
      appeals to what is fundamental, to passion and the instincts; the
      philosophers to what is superficial and supererogatory&mdash;reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the garden; at the head of one of the alleys stood a green
      wooden bench, embayed in the midst of a fragrant continent of lavender
      bushes. It was here, though the place was shadeless and one breathed hot,
      dry perfume instead of air&mdash;it was here that Mr. Scogan elected to
      sit. He thrived on untempered sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider, for example, the case of Luther and Erasmus.&rdquo; He took out his
      pipe and began to fill it as he talked. &ldquo;There was Erasmus, a man of
      reason if ever there was one. People listened to him at first&mdash;a new
      virtuoso performing on that elegant and resourceful instrument, the
      intellect; they even admired and venerated him. But did he move them to
      behave as he wanted them to behave&mdash;reasonably, decently, or at least
      a little less porkishly than usual? He did not. And then Luther appears,
      violent, passionate, a madman insanely convinced about matters in which
      there can be no conviction. He shouted, and men rushed to follow him.
      Erasmus was no longer listened to; he was reviled for his reasonableness.
      Luther was serious, Luther was reality&mdash;like the Great War. Erasmus
      was only reason and decency; he lacked the power, being a sage, to move
      men to action. Europe followed Luther and embarked on a century and a half
      of war and bloody persecution. It&rsquo;s a melancholy story.&rdquo; Mr. Scogan
      lighted a match. In the intense light the flame was all but invisible. The
      smell of burning tobacco began to mingle with the sweetly acrid smell of
      the lavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to get men to act reasonably, you must set about persuading
      them in a maniacal manner. The very sane precepts of the founders of
      religions are only made infectious by means of enthusiasms which to a sane
      man must appear deplorable. It is humiliating to find how impotent
      unadulterated sanity is. Sanity, for example, informs us that the only way
      in which we can preserve civilisation is by behaving decently and
      intelligently. Sanity appeals and argues; our rulers persevere in their
      customary porkishness, while we acquiesce and obey. The only hope is a
      maniacal crusade; I am ready, when it comes, to beat a tambourine with the
      loudest, but at the same time I shall feel a little ashamed of myself.
      However&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Scogan shrugged his shoulders and, pipe in hand, made a
      gesture of resignation&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s futile to complain that things are as
      they are. The fact remains that sanity unassisted is useless. What we
      want, then, is a sane and reasonable exploitation of the forces of
      insanity. We sane men will have the power yet.&rdquo; Mr. Scogan&rsquo;s eyes shone
      with a more than ordinary brightness, and, taking his pipe out of his
      mouth, he gave vent to his loud, dry, and somehow rather fiendish laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want power,&rdquo; said Denis. He was sitting in limp discomfort at
      one end of the bench, shading his eyes from the intolerable light. Mr.
      Scogan, bolt upright at the other end, laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody wants power,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Power in some form or other. The sort
      of power you hanker for is literary power. Some people want power to
      persecute other human beings; you expend your lust for power in
      persecuting words, twisting them, moulding them, torturing them to obey
      you. But I divagate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; asked Denis faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan continued, unheeding, &ldquo;the time will come. We men of
      intelligence will learn to harness the insanities to the service of
      reason. We can&rsquo;t leave the world any longer to the direction of chance. We
      can&rsquo;t allow dangerous maniacs like Luther, mad about dogma, like Napoleon,
      mad about himself, to go on casually appearing and turning everything
      upside down. In the past it didn&rsquo;t so much matter; but our modern machine
      is too delicate. A few more knocks like the Great War, another Luther or
      two, and the whole concern will go to pieces. In future, the men of reason
      must see that the madness of the world&rsquo;s maniacs is canalised into proper
      channels, is made to do useful work, like a mountain torrent driving a
      dynamo...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making electricity to light a Swiss hotel,&rdquo; said Denis. &ldquo;You ought to
      complete the simile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan waved away the interruption. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to be
      done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The men of intelligence must combine, must conspire, and
      seize power from the imbeciles and maniacs who now direct us. They must
      found the Rational State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heat that was slowly paralysing all Denis&rsquo;s mental and bodily
      faculties, seemed to bring to Mr. Scogan additional vitality. He talked
      with an ever-increasing energy, his hands moved in sharp, quick, precise
      gestures, his eyes shone. Hard, dry, and continuous, his voice went on
      sounding and sounding in Denis&rsquo;s ears with the insistence of a mechanical
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Rational State,&rdquo; he heard Mr. Scogan saying, &ldquo;human beings will be
      separated out into distinct species, not according to the colour of their
      eyes or the shape of their skulls, but according to the qualities of their
      mind and temperament. Examining psychologists, trained to what would now
      seem an almost superhuman clairvoyance, will test each child that is born
      and assign it to its proper species. Duly labelled and docketed, the child
      will be given the education suitable to members of its species, and will
      be set, in adult life, to perform those functions which human beings of
      his variety are capable of performing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many species will there be?&rdquo; asked Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many, no doubt,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan answered; &ldquo;the classification will be
      subtle and elaborate. But it is not in the power of a prophet to go into
      details, nor is it his business. I will do more than indicate the three
      main species into which the subjects of the Rational State will be
      divided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, cleared his throat, and coughed once or twice, evoking in
      Denis&rsquo;s mind the vision of a table with a glass and water-bottle, and,
      lying across one corner, a long white pointer for the lantern pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The three main species,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan went on, &ldquo;will be these: the
      Directing Intelligences, the Men of Faith, and the Herd. Among the
      Intelligences will be found all those capable of thought, those who know
      how to attain a certain degree of freedom&mdash;and, alas, how limited,
      even among the most intelligent, that freedom is!&mdash;from the mental
      bondage of their time. A select body of Intelligences, drawn from among
      those who have turned their attention to the problems of practical life,
      will be the governors of the Rational State. They will employ as their
      instruments of power the second great species of humanity&mdash;the men of
      Faith, the Madmen, as I have been calling them, who believe in things
      unreasonably, with passion, and are ready to die for their beliefs and
      their desires. These wild men, with their fearful potentialities for good
      or for mischief, will no longer be allowed to react casually to a casual
      environment. There will be no more Caesar Borgias, no more Luthers and
      Mohammeds, no more Joanna Southcotts, no more Comstocks. The old-fashioned
      Man of Faith and Desire, that haphazard creature of brute circumstance,
      who might drive men to tears and repentance, or who might equally well set
      them on to cutting one another&rsquo;s throats, will be replaced by a new sort
      of madman, still externally the same, still bubbling with a seemingly
      spontaneous enthusiasm, but, ah, how very different from the madman of the
      past! For the new Man of Faith will be expending his passion, his desire,
      and his enthusiasm in the propagation of some reasonable idea. He will be,
      all unawares, the tool of some superior intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan chuckled maliciously; it was as though he were taking a
      revenge, in the name of reason, on enthusiasts. &ldquo;From their earliest
      years, as soon, that is, as the examining psychologists have assigned them
      their place in the classified scheme, the Men of Faith will have had their
      special education under the eye of the Intelligences. Moulded by a long
      process of suggestion, they will go out into the world, preaching and
      practising with a generous mania the coldly reasonable projects of the
      Directors from above. When these projects are accomplished, or when the
      ideas that were useful a decade ago have ceased to be useful, the
      Intelligences will inspire a new generation of madmen with a new eternal
      truth. The principal function of the Men of Faith will be to move and
      direct the Multitude, that third great species consisting of those
      countless millions who lack intelligence and are without valuable
      enthusiasm. When any particular effort is required of the Herd, when it is
      thought necessary, for the sake of solidarity, that humanity shall be
      kindled and united by some single enthusiastic desire or idea, the Men of
      Faith, primed with some simple and satisfying creed, will be sent out on a
      mission of evangelisation. At ordinary times, when the high spiritual
      temperature of a Crusade would be unhealthy, the Men of Faith will be
      quietly and earnestly busy with the great work of education. In the
      upbringing of the Herd, humanity&rsquo;s almost boundless suggestibility will be
      scientifically exploited. Systematically, from earliest infancy, its
      members will be assured that there is no happiness to be found except in
      work and obedience; they will be made to believe that they are happy, that
      they are tremendously important beings, and that everything they do is
      noble and significant. For the lower species the earth will be restored to
      the centre of the universe and man to pre-eminence on the earth. Oh, I
      envy the lot of the commonality in the Rational State! Working their eight
      hours a day, obeying their betters, convinced of their own grandeur and
      significance and immortality, they will be marvellously happy, happier
      than any race of men has ever been. They will go through life in a rosy
      state of intoxication, from which they will never awake. The Men of Faith
      will play the cup-bearers at this lifelong bacchanal, filling and ever
      filling again with the warm liquor that the Intelligences, in sad and
      sober privacy behind the scenes, will brew for the intoxication of their
      subjects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will be my place in the Rational State?&rdquo; Denis drowsily inquired
      from under his shading hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan looked at him for a moment in silence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to see
      where you would fit in,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do manual work;
      you&rsquo;re too independent and unsuggestible to belong to the larger Herd; you
      have none of the characteristics required in a Man of Faith. As for the
      Directing Intelligences, they will have to be marvellously clear and
      merciless and penetrating.&rdquo; He paused and shook his head. &ldquo;No, I can see
      no place for you; only the lethal chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deeply hurt, Denis emitted the imitation of a loud Homeric laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      getting sunstroke here,&rdquo; he said, and got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan followed his example, and they walked slowly away down the
      narrow path, brushing the blue lavender flowers in their passage. Denis
      pulled a sprig of lavender and sniffed at it; then some dark leaves of
      rosemary that smelt like incense in a cavernous church. They passed a bed
      of opium poppies, dispetaled now; the round, ripe seedheads were brown and
      dry&mdash;like Polynesian trophies, Denis thought; severed heads stuck on
      poles. He liked the fancy enough to impart it to Mr. Scogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Polynesian trophies...&rdquo; Uttered aloud, the fancy seemed less
      charming and significant than it did when it first occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, and in a growing wave of sound the whir of the
      reaping machines swelled up from the fields beyond the garden and then
      receded into a remoter hum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is satisfactory to think,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, as they strolled slowly
      onward, &ldquo;that a multitude of people are toiling in the harvest fields in
      order that we may talk of Polynesia. Like every other good thing in this
      world, leisure and culture have to be paid for. Fortunately, however, it
      is not the leisured and the cultured who have to pay. Let us be duly
      thankful for that, my dear Denis&mdash;duly thankful,&rdquo; he repeated, and
      knocked the ashes out of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis was not listening. He had suddenly remembered Anne. She was with
      Gombauld&mdash;alone with him in his studio. It was an intolerable
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go and pay a call on Gombauld?&rdquo; he suggested carelessly. &ldquo;It
      would be amusing to see what he&rsquo;s doing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed inwardly to think how furious Gombauld would be when he saw
      them arriving.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>ombauld was by no
      means so furious at their apparition as Denis had hoped and expected he
      would be. Indeed, he was rather pleased than annoyed when the two faces,
      one brown and pointed, the other round and pale, appeared in the frame of
      the open door. The energy born of his restless irritation was dying within
      him, returning to its emotional elements. A moment more and he would have
      been losing his temper again&mdash;and Anne would be keeping hers,
      infuriatingly. Yes, he was positively glad to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; he called out hospitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed by Mr. Scogan, Denis climbed the little ladder and stepped over
      the threshold. He looked suspiciously from Gombauld to his sitter, and
      could learn nothing from the expression of their faces except that they
      both seemed pleased to see the visitors. Were they really glad, or were
      they cunningly simulating gladness? He wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan, meanwhile, was looking at the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; he said approvingly, &ldquo;excellent. Almost too true to
      character, if that is possible; yes, positively too true. But I&rsquo;m
      surprised to find you putting in all this psychology business.&rdquo; He pointed
      to the face, and with his extended finger followed the slack curves of the
      painted figure. &ldquo;I thought you were one of the fellows who went in
      exclusively for balanced masses and impinging planes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld laughed. &ldquo;This is a little infidelity,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;I for one, without ever having had the
      slightest appreciation of painting, have always taken particular pleasure
      in Cubismus. I like to see pictures from which nature has been completely
      banished, pictures which are exclusively the product of the human mind.
      They give me the same pleasure as I derive from a good piece of reasoning
      or a mathematical problem or an achievement of engineering. Nature, or
      anything that reminds me of nature, disturbs me; it is too large, too
      complicated, above all too utterly pointless and incomprehensible. I am at
      home with the works of man; if I choose to set my mind to it, I can
      understand anything that any man has made or thought. That is why I always
      travel by Tube, never by bus if I can possibly help it. For, travelling by
      bus, one can&rsquo;t avoid seeing, even in London, a few stray works of God&mdash;the
      sky, for example, an occasional tree, the flowers in the window-boxes. But
      travel by Tube and you see nothing but the works of man&mdash;iron riveted
      into geometrical forms, straight lines of concrete, patterned expanses of
      tiles. All is human and the product of friendly and comprehensible minds.
      All philosophies and all religions&mdash;what are they but spiritual Tubes
      bored through the universe! Through these narrow tunnels, where all is
      recognisably human, one travels comfortable and secure, contriving to
      forget that all round and below and above them stretches the blind mass of
      earth, endless and unexplored. Yes, give me the Tube and Cubismus every
      time; give me ideas, so snug and neat and simple and well made. And
      preserve me from nature, preserve me from all that&rsquo;s inhumanly large and
      complicated and obscure. I haven&rsquo;t the courage, and, above all, I haven&rsquo;t
      the time to start wandering in that labyrinth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Scogan was discoursing, Denis had crossed over to the farther
      side of the little square chamber, where Anne was sitting, still in her
      graceful, lazy pose, on the low chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded, looking at her almost fiercely. What was he asking of
      her? He hardly knew himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked up at him, and for answer echoed his &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; in another, a
      laughing key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis had nothing more, at the moment, to say. Two or three canvases stood
      in the corner behind Anne&rsquo;s chair, their faces turned to the wall. He
      pulled them out and began to look at the paintings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see too?&rdquo; Anne requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood them in a row against the wall. Anne had to turn round in her
      chair to look at them. There was the big canvas of the man fallen from the
      horse, there was a painting of flowers, there was a small landscape. His
      hands on the back of the chair, Denis leaned over her. From behind the
      easel at the other side of the room Mr. Scogan was talking away. For a
      long time they looked at the pictures, saying nothing; or, rather, Anne
      looked at the pictures, while Denis, for the most part, looked at Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the man and the horse; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said at last, looking up
      with an inquiring smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis nodded, and then in a queer, strangled voice, as though it had cost
      him a great effort to utter the words, he said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a remark which Anne had heard a good many times before and mostly
      heard with equanimity. But on this occasion&mdash;perhaps because they had
      come so unexpectedly, perhaps for some other reason&mdash;the words
      provoked in her a certain surprised commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Denis,&rdquo; she managed to say, with a laugh; but she was blushing as
      she spoke.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was noon. Denis,
      descending from his chamber, where he had been making an unsuccessful
      effort to write something about nothing in particular, found the
      drawing-room deserted. He was about to go out into the garden when his eye
      fell on a familiar but mysterious object&mdash;the large red notebook in
      which he had so often seen Jenny quietly and busily scribbling. She had
      left it lying on the window-seat. The temptation was great. He picked up
      the book and slipped off the elastic band that kept it discreetly closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private. Not to be opened,&rdquo; was written in capital letters on the cover.
      He raised his eyebrows. It was the sort of thing one wrote in one&rsquo;s Latin
      Grammar while one was still at one&rsquo;s preparatory school.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Black is the raven, black is the rook,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But blacker the thief who steals this book!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curiously childish, he thought, and he smiled to himself. He opened
      the book. What he saw made him wince as though he had been struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis was his own severest critic; so, at least, he had always believed.
      He liked to think of himself as a merciless vivisector probing into the
      palpitating entrails of his own soul; he was Brown Dog to himself. His
      weaknesses, his absurdities&mdash;no one knew them better than he did.
      Indeed, in a vague way he imagined that nobody beside himself was aware of
      them at all. It seemed, somehow, inconceivable that he should appear to
      other people as they appeared to him; inconceivable that they ever spoke
      of him among themselves in that same freely critical and, to be quite
      honest, mildly malicious tone in which he was accustomed to talk of them.
      In his own eyes he had defects, but to see them was a privilege reserved
      to him alone. For the rest of the world he was surely an image of flawless
      crystal. It was almost axiomatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      On opening the red notebook that crystal image of himself crashed to the
      ground, and was irreparably shattered. He was not his own severest critic
      after all. The discovery was a painful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fruit of Jenny&rsquo;s unobtrusive scribbling lay before him. A caricature
      of himself, reading (the book was upside-down). In the background a
      dancing couple, recognisable as Gombauld and Anne. Beneath, the legend:
      &ldquo;Fable of the Wallflower and the Sour Grapes.&rdquo; Fascinated and horrified,
      Denis pored over the drawing. It was masterful. A mute, inglorious
      Rouveyre appeared in every one of those cruelly clear lines. The
      expression of the face, an assumed aloofness and superiority tempered by a
      feeble envy; the attitude of the body and limbs, an attitude of studious
      and scholarly dignity, given away by the fidgety pose of the turned-in
      feet&mdash;these things were terrible. And, more terrible still, was the
      likeness, was the magisterial certainty with which his physical
      peculiarities were all recorded and subtly exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis looked deeper into the book. There were caricatures of other people:
      of Priscilla and Mr. Barbecue-Smith; of Henry Wimbush, of Anne and
      Gombauld; of Mr. Scogan, whom Jenny had represented in a light that was
      more than slightly sinister, that was, indeed, diabolic; of Mary and Ivor.
      He scarcely glanced at them. A fearful desire to know the worst about
      himself possessed him. He turned over the leaves, lingering at nothing
      that was not his own image. Seven full pages were devoted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private. Not to be opened.&rdquo; He had disobeyed the injunction; he had only
      got what he deserved. Thoughtfully he closed the book, and slid the rubber
      band once more into its place. Sadder and wiser, he went out on to the
      terrace. And so this, he reflected, this was how Jenny employed the
      leisure hours in her ivory tower apart. And he had thought her a
      simple-minded, uncritical creature! It was he, it seemed, who was the
      fool. He felt no resentment towards Jenny. No, the distressing thing
      wasn&rsquo;t Jenny herself; it was what she and the phenomenon of her red book
      represented, what they stood for and concretely symbolised. They
      represented all the vast conscious world of men outside himself; they
      symbolised something that in his studious solitariness he was apt not to
      believe in. He could stand at Piccadilly Circus, could watch the crowds
      shuffle past, and still imagine himself the one fully conscious,
      intelligent, individual being among all those thousands. It seemed,
      somehow, impossible that other people should be in their way as elaborate
      and complete as he in his. Impossible; and yet, periodically he would make
      some painful discovery about the external world and the horrible reality
      of its consciousness and its intelligence. The red notebook was one of
      these discoveries, a footprint in the sand. It put beyond a doubt the fact
      that the outer world really existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on the balustrade of the terrace, he ruminated this unpleasant
      truth for some time. Still chewing on it, he strolled pensively down
      towards the swimming-pool. A peacock and his hen trailed their shabby
      finery across the turf of the lower lawn. Odious birds! Their necks, thick
      and greedily fleshy at the roots, tapered up to the cruel inanity of their
      brainless heads, their flat eyes and piercing beaks. The fabulists were
      right, he reflected, when they took beasts to illustrate their tractates
      of human morality. Animals resemble men with all the truthfulness of a
      caricature. (Oh, the red notebook!) He threw a piece of stick at the
      slowly pacing birds. They rushed towards it, thinking it was something to
      eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on. The profound shade of a giant ilex tree engulfed him. Like a
      great wooden octopus, it spread its long arms abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Under the spreading ilex tree...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to remember who the poem was by, but couldn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The smith, a brawny man is he,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With arms like rubber bands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like his; he would have to try and do his Muller exercises more
      regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He emerged once more into the sunshine. The pool lay before him,
      reflecting in its bronze mirror the blue and various green of the summer
      day. Looking at it, he thought of Anne&rsquo;s bare arms and seal-sleek
      bathing-dress, her moving knees and feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;And little Luce with the white legs,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And bouncing Barbary...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, these rags and tags of other people&rsquo;s making! Would he ever be able to
      call his brain his own? Was there, indeed, anything in it that was truly
      his own, or was it simply an education?
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly round the water&rsquo;s edge. In an embayed recess among the
      surrounding yew trees, leaning her back against the pedestal of a
      pleasantly comic version of the Medici Venus, executed by some nameless
      mason of the seicento, he saw Mary pensively sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said, for he was passing so close to her that he had to say
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked up. &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; she answered in a melancholy, uninterested tone.

    <p>
      In this alcove hewed out of the dark trees, the atmosphere seemed to Denis
      agreeably elegiac. He sat down beside her under the shadow of the pudic
      goddess. There was a prolonged silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast that morning Mary had found on her plate a picture postcard
      of Gobley Great Park. A stately Georgian pile, with a facade sixteen
      windows wide; parterres in the foreground; huge, smooth lawns receding out
      of the picture to right and left. Ten years more of the hard times and
      Gobley, with all its peers, will be deserted and decaying. Fifty years,
      and the countryside will know the old landmarks no more. They will have
      vanished as the monasteries vanished before them. At the moment, however,
      Mary&rsquo;s mind was not moved by these considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the back of the postcard, next to the address, was written, in Ivor&rsquo;s
      bold, large hand, a single quatrain.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      &ldquo;Hail, maid of moonlight! Bride of the sun, farewell!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Like bright plumes moulted in an angel&rsquo;s flight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      There sleep within my heart&rsquo;s most mystic cell
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Memories of morning, memories of the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a postscript of three lines: &ldquo;Would you mind asking one of
      the housemaids to forward the packet of safety-razor blades I left in the
      drawer of my washstand. Thanks.&mdash;Ivor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seated under the Venus&rsquo;s immemorial gesture, Mary considered life and
      love. The abolition of her repressions, so far from bringing the expected
      peace of mind, had brought nothing but disquiet, a new and hitherto
      unexperienced misery. Ivor, Ivor...She couldn&rsquo;t do without him now. It was
      evident, on the other hand, from the poem on the back of the picture
      postcard, that Ivor could very well do without her. He was at Gobley now,
      so was Zenobia. Mary knew Zenobia. She thought of the last verse of the
      song he had sung that night in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Le lendemain, Phillis peu sage
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Aurait donne moutons et chien
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Pour un baiser que le volage
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A Lisette donnait pour rien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary shed tears at the memory; she had never been so unhappy in all her
      life before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Denis who first broke the silence. &ldquo;The individual,&rdquo; he began in a
      soft and sadly philosophical tone, &ldquo;is not a self-supporting universe.
      There are times when he comes into contact with other individuals, when he
      is forced to take cognisance of the existence of other universes besides
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had contrived this highly abstract generalisation as a preliminary to a
      personal confidence. It was the first gambit in a conversation that was to
      lead up to Jenny&rsquo;s caricatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mary; and, generalising for herself, she added, &ldquo;When one
      individual comes into intimate contact with another, she&mdash;or he, of
      course, as the case may be&mdash;must almost inevitably receive or inflict
      suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is apt,&rdquo; Denis went on, &ldquo;to be so spellbound by the spectacle of
      one&rsquo;s own personality that one forgets that the spectacle presents itself
      to other people as well as to oneself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was not listening. &ldquo;The difficulty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;makes itself acutely
      felt in matters of sex. If one individual seeks intimate contact with
      another individual in the natural way, she is certain to receive or
      inflict suffering. If on the other hand, she avoids contacts, she risks
      the equally grave sufferings that follow on unnatural repressions. As you
      see, it&rsquo;s a dilemma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I think of my own case,&rdquo; said Denis, making a more decided move in
      the desired direction, &ldquo;I am amazed how ignorant I am of other people&rsquo;s
      mentality in general, and above all and in particular, of their opinions
      about myself. Our minds are sealed books only occasionally opened to the
      outside world.&rdquo; He made a gesture that was faintly suggestive of the
      drawing off of a rubber band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful problem,&rdquo; said Mary thoughtfully. &ldquo;One has to have had
      personal experience to realise quite how awful it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Denis nodded. &ldquo;One has to have had first-hand experience.&rdquo; He
      leaned towards her and slightly lowered his voice. &ldquo;This very morning, for
      example...&rdquo; he began, but his confidences were cut short. The deep voice
      of the gong, tempered by distance to a pleasant booming, floated down from
      the house. It was lunch-time. Mechanically Mary rose to her feet, and
      Denis, a little hurt that she should exhibit such a desperate anxiety for
      her food and so slight an interest in his spiritual experiences, followed
      her. They made their way up to the house without speaking.

      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> hope you all
      realise,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush during dinner, &ldquo;that next Monday is Bank
      Holiday, and that you will all be expected to help in the Fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Anne. &ldquo;The Fair&mdash;I had forgotten all about it. What
      a nightmare! Couldn&rsquo;t you put a stop to it, Uncle Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wimbush sighed and shook his head. &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I fear I cannot.
      I should have liked to put an end to it years ago; but the claims of
      Charity are strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not charity we want,&rdquo; Anne murmured rebelliously; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Mr. Wimbush went on, &ldquo;the Fair has become an institution. Let
      me see, it must be twenty-two years since we started it. It was a modest
      affair then. Now...&rdquo; he made a sweeping movement with his hand and was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It spoke highly for Mr. Wimbush&rsquo;s public spirit that he still continued to
      tolerate the Fair. Beginning as a sort of glorified church bazaar, Crome&rsquo;s
      yearly Charity Fair had grown into a noisy thing of merry-go-rounds,
      cocoanut shies, and miscellaneous side shows&mdash;a real genuine fair on
      the grand scale. It was the local St. Bartholomew, and the people of all
      the neighbouring villages, with even a contingent from the county town,
      flocked into the park for their Bank Holiday amusement. The local hospital
      profited handsomely, and it was this fact alone which prevented Mr.
      Wimbush, to whom the Fair was a cause of recurrent and never-diminishing
      agony, from putting a stop to the nuisance which yearly desecrated his
      park and garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made all the arrangements already,&rdquo; Henry Wimbush went on. &ldquo;Some of
      the larger marquees will be put up to-morrow. The swings and the
      merry-go-round arrive on Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s no escape,&rdquo; said Anne, turning to the rest of the party.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll all have to do something. As a special favour you&rsquo;re allowed to
      choose your slavery. My job is the tea tent, as usual, Aunt Priscilla...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wimbush, interrupting her, &ldquo;I have more important
      things to think about than the Fair. But you need have no doubt that I
      shall do my best when Monday comes to encourage the villagers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Aunt Priscilla will encourage the
      villagers. What will you do, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do anything where I have to stand by and watch other people eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll look after the children&rsquo;s sports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Mary agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after the children&rsquo;s sports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Scogan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan reflected. &ldquo;May I be allowed to tell fortunes?&rdquo; he asked at
      last. &ldquo;I think I should be good at telling fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t tell fortunes in that costume!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan surveyed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be dressed up. Do you still persist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to suffer all indignities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Anne; and turning to Gombauld, &ldquo;You must be our lightning
      artist,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Your portrait for a shilling in five minutes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity I&rsquo;m not Ivor,&rdquo; said Gombauld, with a laugh. &ldquo;I could throw in
      a picture of their Auras for an extra sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary flushed. &ldquo;Nothing is to be gained,&rdquo; she said severely, &ldquo;by speaking
      with levity of serious subjects. And, after all, whatever your personal
      views may be, psychical research is a perfectly serious subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis made a deprecating gesture. &ldquo;I have no accomplishments,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just be one of those men who wear a thing in their buttonholes and
      go about telling people which is the way to tea and not to walk on the
      grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. You must do something more than
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what? All the good jobs are taken, and I can do nothing but lisp in
      numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you must lisp,&rdquo; concluded Anne. &ldquo;You must write a poem for
      the occasion&mdash;an &lsquo;Ode on Bank Holiday.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll print it on Uncle
      Henry&rsquo;s press and sell it at twopence a copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixpence,&rdquo; Denis protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be worth sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne shook her head. &ldquo;Twopence,&rdquo; she repeated firmly. &ldquo;Nobody will pay
      more than twopence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now there&rsquo;s Jenny,&rdquo; said Mr Wimbush. &ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; he said, raising his
      voice, &ldquo;what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis thought of suggesting that she might draw caricatures at sixpence an
      execution, but decided it would be wiser to go on feigning ignorance of
      her talent. His mind reverted to the red notebook. Could it really be true
      that he looked like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will I do,&rdquo; Jenny echoed, &ldquo;what will I do?&rdquo; She frowned thoughtfully
      for a moment; then her face brightened and she smiled. &ldquo;When I was young,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;I learnt to play the drums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drums?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny nodded, and, in proof of her assertion, agitated her knife and fork,
      like a pair of drumsticks, over her plate. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any opportunity of
      playing the drums...&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s any amount of opportunity. We&rsquo;ll put
      you down definitely for the drums. That&rsquo;s the lot,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very good lot too,&rdquo; said Gombauld. &ldquo;I look forward to my Bank
      Holiday. It ought to be gay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought indeed,&rdquo; Mr Scogan assented. &ldquo;But you may rest assured that it
      won&rsquo;t be. No holiday is ever anything but a disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; protested Gombauld. &ldquo;My holiday at Crome isn&rsquo;t being a
      disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Anne turned an ingenuous mask towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the very nature of things,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan went on; &ldquo;our holidays
      can&rsquo;t help being disappointments. Reflect for a moment. What is a holiday?
      The ideal, the Platonic Holiday of Holidays is surely a complete and
      absolute change. You agree with me in my definition?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan glanced
      from face to face round the table; his sharp nose moved in a series of
      rapid jerks through all the points of the compass. There was no sign of
      dissent; he continued: &ldquo;A complete and absolute change; very well. But
      isn&rsquo;t a complete and absolute change precisely the thing we can never have&mdash;never,
      in the very nature of things?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan once more looked rapidly about
      him. &ldquo;Of course it is. As ourselves, as specimens of Homo Sapiens, as
      members of a society, how can we hope to have anything like an absolute
      change? We are tied down by the frightful limitation of our human
      faculties, by the notions which society imposes on us through our fatal
      suggestibility, by our own personalities. For us, a complete holiday is
      out of the question. Some of us struggle manfully to take one, but we
      never succeed, if I may be allowed to express myself metaphorically, we
      never succeed in getting farther than Southend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re depressing,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to be,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan replied, and, expanding the fingers of his
      right hand, he went on: &ldquo;Look at me, for example. What sort of a holiday
      can I take? In endowing me with passions and faculties Nature has been
      horribly niggardly. The full range of human potentialities is in any case
      distressingly limited; my range is a limitation within a limitation. Out
      of the ten octaves that make up the human instrument, I can compass
      perhaps two. Thus, while I may have a certain amount of intelligence, I
      have no aesthetic sense; while I possess the mathematical faculty, I am
      wholly without the religious emotions; while I am naturally addicted to
      venery, I have little ambition and am not at all avaricious. Education has
      further limited my scope. Having been brought up in society, I am
      impregnated with its laws; not only should I be afraid of taking a holiday
      from them, I should also feel it painful to try to do so. In a word, I
      have a conscience as well as a fear of gaol. Yes, I know it by experience.
      How often have I tried to take holidays, to get away from myself, my own
      boring nature, my insufferable mental surroundings!&rdquo; Mr. Scogan sighed.
      &ldquo;But always without success,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;always without success. In my
      youth I was always striving&mdash;how hard!&mdash;to feel religiously and
      aesthetically. Here, said I to myself, are two tremendously important and
      exciting emotions. Life would be richer, warmer, brighter, altogether more
      amusing, if I could feel them. I try to feel them. I read the works of the
      mystics. They seemed to me nothing but the most deplorable claptrap&mdash;as
      indeed they always must to anyone who does not feel the same emotion as
      the authors felt when they were writing. For it is the emotion that
      matters. The written work is simply an attempt to express emotion, which
      is in itself inexpressible, in terms of intellect and logic. The mystic
      objectifies a rich feeling in the pit of the stomach into a cosmology. For
      other mystics that cosmology is a symbol of the rich feeling. For the
      unreligious it is a symbol of nothing, and so appears merely grotesque. A
      melancholy fact! But I divagate.&rdquo; Mr. Scogan checked himself. &ldquo;So much for
      the religious emotion. As for the aesthetic&mdash;I was at even greater
      pains to cultivate that. I have looked at all the right works of art in
      every part of Europe. There was a time when, I venture to believe, I knew
      more about Taddeo da Poggibonsi, more about the cryptic Amico di Taddeo,
      even than Henry does. To-day, I am happy to say, I have forgotten most of
      the knowledge I then so laboriously acquired; but without vanity I can
      assert that it was prodigious. I don&rsquo;t pretend, of course, to know
      anything about nigger sculpture or the later seventeenth century in Italy;
      but about all the periods that were fashionable before 1900 I am, or was,
      omniscient. Yes, I repeat it, omniscient. But did that fact make me any
      more appreciative of art in general? It did not. Confronted by a picture,
      of which I could tell you all the known and presumed history&mdash;the
      date when it was painted, the character of the painter, the influences
      that had gone to make it what it was&mdash;I felt none of that strange
      excitement and exaltation which is, as I am informed by those who do feel
      it, the true aesthetic emotion. I felt nothing but a certain interest in
      the subject of the picture; or more often, when the subject was hackneyed
      and religious, I felt nothing but a great weariness of spirit.
      Nevertheless, I must have gone on looking at pictures for ten years before
      I would honestly admit to myself that they merely bored me. Since then I
      have given up all attempts to take a holiday. I go on cultivating my old
      stale daily self in the resigned spirit with which a bank clerk performs
      from ten till six his daily task. A holiday, indeed! I&rsquo;m sorry for you,
      Gombauld, if you still look forward to having a holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my standards aren&rsquo;t
      as elevated as yours. But personally I found the war quite as thorough a
      holiday from all the ordinary decencies and sanities, all the common
      emotions and preoccupations, as I ever want to have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Scogan thoughtfully agreed. &ldquo;Yes, the war was certainly
      something of a holiday. It was a step beyond Southend; it was
      Weston-super-Mare; it was almost Ilfracombe.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> little canvas
      village of tents and booths had sprung up, just beyond the boundaries of
      the garden, in the green expanse of the park. A crowd thronged its
      streets, the men dressed mostly in black&mdash;holiday best, funeral best&mdash;the
      women in pale muslins. Here and there tricolour bunting hung inert. In the
      midst of the canvas town, scarlet and gold and crystal, the merry-go-round
      glittered in the sun. The balloon-man walked among the crowd, and above
      his head, like a huge, inverted bunch of many-coloured grapes, the
      balloons strained upwards. With a scythe-like motion the boat-swings
      reaped the air, and from the funnel of the engine which worked the
      roundabout rose a thin, scarcely wavering column of black smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis had climbed to the top of one of Sir Ferdinando&rsquo;s towers, and there,
      standing on the sun-baked leads, his elbows resting on the parapet, he
      surveyed the scene. The steam-organ sent up prodigious music. The clashing
      of automatic cymbals beat out with inexorable precision the rhythm of
      piercingly sounded melodies. The harmonies were like a musical shattering
      of glass and brass. Far down in the bass the Last Trump was hugely
      blowing, and with such persistence, such resonance, that its alternate
      tonic and dominant detached themselves from the rest of the music and made
      a tune of their own, a loud, monotonous see-saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis leaned over the gulf of swirling noise. If he threw himself over the
      parapet, the noise would surely buoy him up, keep him suspended, bobbing,
      as a fountain balances a ball on its breaking crest. Another fancy came to
      him, this time in metrical form.

    <p>
      Bad, bad. But he liked the idea of something thin and distended being
      blown up from underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;My soul is a thin tent of gut...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      or better&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;My soul is a pale, tenuous membrane...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That was pleasing: a thin, tenuous membrane. It had the right anatomical
      quality. Tight blown, quivering in the blast of noisy life. It was time
      for him to descend from the serene empyrean of words into the actual
      vortex. He went down slowly. &ldquo;My soul is a thin, tenuous membrane...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the terrace stood a knot of distinguished visitors. There was old Lord
      Moleyn, like a caricature of an English milord in a French comic paper: a
      long man, with a long nose and long, drooping moustaches and long teeth of
      old ivory, and lower down, absurdly, a short covert coat, and below that
      long, long legs cased in pearl-grey trousers&mdash;legs that bent
      unsteadily at the knee and gave a kind of sideways wobble as he walked.
      Beside him, short and thick-set, stood Mr. Callamay, the venerable
      conservative statesman, with a face like a Roman bust, and short white
      hair. Young girls didn&rsquo;t much like going for motor drives alone with Mr.
      Callamay; and of old Lord Moleyn one wondered why he wasn&rsquo;t living in
      gilded exile on the island of Capri among the other distinguished persons
      who, for one reason or another, find it impossible to live in England.
      They were talking to Anne, laughing, the one profoundly, the other
      hootingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A black silk balloon towing a black-and-white striped parachute proved to
      be old Mrs. Budge from the big house on the other side of the valley. She
      stood low on the ground, and the spikes of her black-and-white sunshade
      menaced the eyes of Priscilla Wimbush, who towered over her&mdash;a
      massive figure dressed in purple and topped with a queenly toque on which
      the nodding black plumes recalled the splendours of a first-class Parisian
      funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis peeped at them discreetly from the window of the morning-room. His
      eyes were suddenly become innocent, childlike, unprejudiced. They seemed,
      these people, inconceivably fantastic. And yet they really existed, they
      functioned by themselves, they were conscious, they had minds. Moreover,
      he was like them. Could one believe it? But the evidence of the red
      notebook was conclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been polite to go and say, &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you do?&rdquo; But at the moment
      Denis did not want to talk, could not have talked. His soul was a tenuous,
      tremulous, pale membrane. He would keep its sensibility intact and virgin
      as long as he could. Cautiously he crept out by a side door and made his
      way down towards the park. His soul fluttered as he approached the noise
      and movement of the fair. He paused for a moment on the brink, then
      stepped in and was engulfed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of people, each with his own private face and all of them real,
      separate, alive: the thought was disquieting. He paid twopence and saw the
      Tatooed Woman; twopence more, the Largest Rat in the World. From the home
      of the Rat he emerged just in time to see a hydrogen-filled balloon break
      loose for home. A child howled up after it; but calmly, a perfect sphere
      of flushed opal, it mounted, mounted. Denis followed it with his eyes
      until it became lost in the blinding sunlight. If he could but send his
      soul to follow it!...
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, stuck his steward&rsquo;s rosette in his buttonhole, and started to
      push his way, aimlessly but officially, through the crowd.

      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Scogan had been
      accommodated in a little canvas hut. Dressed in a black skirt and a red
      bodice, with a yellow-and-red bandana handkerchief tied round his black
      wig, he looked&mdash;sharp-nosed, brown, and wrinkled&mdash;like the
      Bohemian Hag of Frith&rsquo;s Derby Day. A placard pinned to the curtain of the
      doorway announced the presence within the tent of &ldquo;Sesostris, the
      Sorceress of Ecbatana.&rdquo; Seated at a table, Mr. Scogan received his clients
      in mysterious silence, indicating with a movement of the finger that they
      were to sit down opposite him and to extend their hands for his
      inspection. He then examined the palm that was presented him, using a
      magnifying glass and a pair of horn spectacles. He had a terrifying way of
      shaking his head, frowning and clicking with his tongue as he looked at
      the lines. Sometimes he would whisper, as though to himself, &ldquo;Terrible,
      terrible!&rdquo; or &ldquo;God preserve us!&rdquo; sketching out the sign of the cross as he
      uttered the words. The clients who came in laughing grew suddenly grave;
      they began to take the witch seriously. She was a formidable-looking
      woman; could it be, was it possible, that there was something in this sort
      of thing after all? After all, they thought, as the hag shook her head
      over their hands, after all...And they waited, with an uncomfortably
      beating heart, for the oracle to speak. After a long and silent
      inspection, Mr. Scogan would suddenly look up and ask, in a hoarse
      whisper, some horrifying question, such as, &ldquo;Have you ever been hit on the
      head with a hammer by a young man with red hair?&rdquo; When the answer was in
      the negative, which it could hardly fail to be, Mr. Scogan would nod
      several times, saying, &ldquo;I was afraid so. Everything is still to come,
      still to come, though it can&rsquo;t be very far off now.&rdquo; Sometimes, after a
      long examination, he would just whisper, &ldquo;Where ignorance is bliss, &lsquo;tis
      folly to be wise,&rdquo; and refuse to divulge any details of a future too
      appalling to be envisaged without despair. Sesostris had a success of
      horror. People stood in a queue outside the witch&rsquo;s booth waiting for the
      privilege of hearing sentence pronounced upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis, in the course of his round, looked with curiosity at this crowd of
      suppliants before the shrine of the oracle. He had a great desire to see
      how Mr. Scogan played his part. The canvas booth was a rickety, ill-made
      structure. Between its walls and its sagging roof were long gaping chinks
      and crannies. Denis went to the tea-tent and borrowed a wooden bench and a
      small Union Jack. With these he hurried back to the booth of Sesostris.
      Setting down the bench at the back of the booth, he climbed up, and with a
      great air of busy efficiency began to tie the Union Jack to the top of one
      of the tent-poles. Through the crannies in the canvas he could see almost
      the whole of the interior of the tent. Mr. Scogan&rsquo;s bandana-covered head
      was just below him; his terrifying whispers came clearly up. Denis looked
      and listened while the witch prophesied financial losses, death by
      apoplexy, destruction by air-raids in the next war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there going to be another war?&rdquo; asked the old lady to whom he had
      predicted this end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, with an air of quiet confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was succeeded by a girl dressed in white muslin, garnished
      with pink ribbons. She was wearing a broad hat, so that Denis could not
      see her face; but from her figure and the roundness of her bare arms he
      judged her young and pleasing. Mr. Scogan looked at her hand, then
      whispered, &ldquo;You are still virtuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady giggled and exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, lor&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not remain so for long,&rdquo; added Mr. Scogan sepulchrally. The
      young lady giggled again. &ldquo;Destiny, which interests itself in small things
      no less than in great, has announced the fact upon your hand.&rdquo; Mr. Scogan
      took up the magnifying-glass and began once more to examine the white
      palm. &ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; he said, as though to himself&mdash;&ldquo;very
      interesting. It&rsquo;s as clear as day.&rdquo; He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s clear?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ought to tell you.&rdquo; Mr. Scogan shook his head; the
      pendulous brass ear-rings which he had screwed on to his ears tinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please!&rdquo; she implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The witch seemed to ignore her remark. &ldquo;Afterwards, it&rsquo;s not at all clear.
      The fates don&rsquo;t say whether you will settle down to married life and have
      four children or whether you will try to go on the cinema and have none.
      They are only specific about this one rather crucial incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What is it? Oh, do tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white muslin figure leant eagerly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan sighed. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you must know, you must know.
      But if anything untoward happens you must blame your own curiosity.
      Listen. Listen.&rdquo; He lifted up a sharp, claw-nailed forefinger. &ldquo;This is
      what the fates have written. Next Sunday afternoon at six o&rsquo;clock you will
      be sitting on the second stile on the footpath that leads from the church
      to the lower road. At that moment a man will appear walking along the
      footpath.&rdquo; Mr. Scogan looked at her hand again as though to refresh his
      memory of the details of the scene. &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;&ldquo;a small
      man with a sharp nose, not exactly good looking nor precisely young, but
      fascinating.&rdquo; He lingered hissingly over the word. &ldquo;He will ask you, &lsquo;Can
      you tell me the way to Paradise?&rsquo; and you will answer, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll show
      you,&rsquo; and walk with him down towards the little hazel copse. I cannot read
      what will happen after that.&rdquo; There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really true?&rdquo; asked white muslin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The witch gave a shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;I merely tell you what I read in
      your hand. Good afternoon. That will be sixpence. Yes, I have change.
      Thank you. Good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis stepped down from the bench; tied insecurely and crookedly to the
      tentpole, the Union Jack hung limp on the windless air. &ldquo;If only I could
      do things like that!&rdquo; he thought, as he carried the bench back to the
      tea-tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was sitting behind a long table filling thick white cups from an urn.
      A neat pile of printed sheets lay before her on the table. Denis took one
      of them and looked at it affectionately. It was his poem. They had printed
      five hundred copies, and very nice the quarto broadsheets looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sold many?&rdquo; he asked in a casual tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne put her head on one side deprecatingly. &ldquo;Only three so far, I&rsquo;m
      afraid. But I&rsquo;m giving a free copy to everyone who spends more than a
      shilling on his tea. So in any case it&rsquo;s having a circulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis made no reply, but walked slowly away. He looked at the broadsheet
      in his hand and read the lines to himself relishingly as he walked along:

      He folded the sheet carefully and put it in his pocket. The thing had its
      merits. Oh, decidedly, decidedly! But how unpleasant the crowd smelt! He
      lit a cigarette. The smell of cows was preferable. He passed through the
      gate in the park wall into the garden. The swimming-pool was a centre of
      noise and activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second Heat in the Young Ladies&rsquo; Championship.&rdquo; It was the polite voice
      of Henry Wimbush. A crowd of sleek, seal-like figures in black
      bathing-dresses surrounded him. His grey bowler hat, smooth, round, and
      motionless in the midst of a moving sea, was an island of aristocratic
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding his tortoise-shell-rimmed pince-nez an inch or two in front of his
      eyes, he read out names from a list.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dolly Miles, Miss Rebecca Balister, Miss Doris Gabell...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five young persons ranged themselves on the brink. From their seats of
      honour at the other end of the pool, old Lord Moleyn and Mr. Callamay
      looked on with eager interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Wimbush raised his hand. There was an expectant silence. &ldquo;When I say
      &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; go. Go!&rdquo; he said. There was an almost simultaneous splash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis pushed his way through the spectators. Somebody plucked him by the
      sleeve; he looked down. It was old Mrs. Budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to see you again, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; she said in her rich, husky
      voice. She panted a little as she spoke, like a short-winded lap-dog. It
      was Mrs. Budge who, having read in the &ldquo;Daily Mirror&rdquo; that the Government
      needed peach stones&mdash;what they needed them for she never knew&mdash;had
      made the collection of peach stones her peculiar &ldquo;bit&rdquo; of war work. She
      had thirty-six peach trees in her walled garden, as well as four
      hot-houses in which trees could be forced, so that she was able to eat
      peaches practically the whole year round. In 1916 she ate 4200 peaches,
      and sent the stones to the Government. In 1917 the military authorities
      called up three of her gardeners, and what with this and the fact that it
      was a bad year for wall fruit, she only managed to eat 2900 peaches during
      that crucial period of the national destinies. In 1918 she did rather
      better, for between January 1st and the date of the Armistice she ate 3300
      peaches. Since the Armistice she had relaxed her efforts; now she did not
      eat more than two or three peaches a day. Her constitution, she
      complained, had suffered; but it had suffered for a good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis answered her greeting by a vague and polite noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So nice to see the young people enjoying themselves,&rdquo; Mrs. Budge went on.
      &ldquo;And the old people too, for that matter. Look at old Lord Moleyn and dear
      Mr. Callamay. Isn&rsquo;t it delightful to see the way they enjoy themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis looked. He wasn&rsquo;t sure whether it was so very delightful after all.
      Why didn&rsquo;t they go and watch the sack races? The two old gentlemen were
      engaged at the moment in congratulating the winner of the race; it seemed
      an act of supererogatory graciousness; for, after all, she had only won a
      heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty little thing, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said Mrs. Budge huskily, and panted two
      or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Denis nodded agreement. Sixteen, slender, but nubile, he said to
      himself, and laid up the phrase in his memory as a happy one. Old Mr.
      Callamay had put on his spectacles to congratulate the victor, and Lord
      Moleyn, leaning forward over his walking-stick, showed his long ivory
      teeth, hungrily smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital performance, capital,&rdquo; Mr. Callamay was saying in his deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victor wriggled with embarrassment. She stood with her hands behind
      her back, rubbing one foot nervously on the other. Her wet bathing-dress
      shone, a torso of black polished marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good indeed,&rdquo; said Lord Moleyn. His voice seemed to come from just
      behind his teeth, a toothy voice. It was as though a dog should suddenly
      begin to speak. He smiled again, Mr. Callamay readjusted his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I say &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; go. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Splash! The third heat had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I never could learn to swim,&rdquo; said Mrs. Budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I used to be able to float.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis imagined her floating&mdash;up and down, up and down on a great
      green swell. A blown black bladder; no, that wasn&rsquo;t good, that wasn&rsquo;t good
      at all. A new winner was being congratulated. She was atrociously stubby
      and fat. The last one, long and harmoniously, continuously curved from
      knee to breast, had been an Eve by Cranach; but this, this one was a bad
      Rubens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...go&mdash;go&mdash;go!&rdquo; Henry Wimbush&rsquo;s polite level voice once more
      pronounced the formula. Another batch of young ladies dived in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grown a little weary of sustaining a conversation with Mrs. Budge, Denis
      conveniently remembered that his duties as a steward called him elsewhere.
      He pushed out through the lines of spectators and made his way along the
      path left clear behind them. He was thinking again that his soul was a
      pale, tenuous membrane, when he was startled by hearing a thin, sibilant
      voice, speaking apparently from just above his head, pronounce the single
      word &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up sharply. The path along which he was walking passed under the
      lee of a wall of clipped yew. Behind the hedge the ground sloped steeply
      up towards the foot of the terrace and the house; for one standing on the
      higher ground it was easy to look over the dark barrier. Looking up, Denis
      saw two heads overtopping the hedge immediately above him. He recognised
      the iron mask of Mr. Bodiham and the pale, colourless face of his wife.
      They were looking over his head, over the heads of the spectators, at the
      swimmers in the pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; Mrs. Bodiham repeated, hissing softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector turned up his iron mask towards the solid cobalt of the sky.
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; he said, as though to himself; &ldquo;how long?&rdquo; He lowered his eyes
      again, and they fell on Denis&rsquo;s upturned curious face. There was an abrupt
      movement, and Mr. and Mrs. Bodiham popped out of sight behind the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis continued his promenade. He wandered past the merry-go-round,
      through the thronged streets of the canvas village; the membrane of his
      soul flapped tumultuously in the noise and laughter. In a roped-off space
      beyond, Mary was directing the children&rsquo;s sports. Little creatures seethed
      round about her, making a shrill, tinny clamour; others clustered about
      the skirts and trousers of their parents. Mary&rsquo;s face was shining in the
      heat; with an immense output of energy she started a three-legged race.
      Denis looked on in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful,&rdquo; he said, coming up behind her and touching her on the
      arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such energy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned towards him a face, round, red, and honest as the setting sun;
      the golden bell of her hair swung silently as she moved her head and
      quivered to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Denis,&rdquo; she said, in a low, serious voice, gasping a little
      as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;do you know that there&rsquo;s a woman here who has had
      three children in thirty-one months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Denis, making rapid mental calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s appalling. I&rsquo;ve been telling her about the Malthusian League. One
      really ought...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a sudden violent renewal of the metallic yelling announced the fact
      that somebody had won the race. Mary became once more the centre of a
      dangerous vortex. It was time, Denis thought, to move on; he might be
      asked to do something if he stayed too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned back towards the canvas village. The thought of tea was making
      itself insistent in his mind. Tea, tea, tea. But the tea-tent was horribly
      thronged. Anne, with an unusual expression of grimness on her flushed
      face, was furiously working the handle of the urn; the brown liquid
      spurted incessantly into the proffered cups. Portentous, in the farther
      corner of the tent, Priscilla, in her royal toque, was encouraging the
      villagers. In a momentary lull Denis could hear her deep, jovial laughter
      and her manly voice. Clearly, he told himself, this was no place for one
      who wanted tea. He stood irresolute at the entrance to the tent. A
      beautiful thought suddenly came to him; if he went back to the house, went
      unobtrusively, without being observed, if he tiptoed into the dining-room
      and noiselessly opened the little doors of the sideboard&mdash;ah, then!
      In the cool recess within he would find bottles and a siphon; a bottle of
      crystal gin and a quart of soda water, and then for the cups that
      inebriate as well as cheer...
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later he was walking briskly up the shady yew-tree walk. Within
      the house it was deliciously quiet and cool. Carrying his well-filled
      tumbler with care, he went into the library. There, the glass on the
      corner of the table beside him, he settled into a chair with a volume of
      Sainte-Beuve. There was nothing, he found, like a Causerie du Lundi for
      settling and soothing the troubled spirits. That tenuous membrane of his
      had been too rudely buffeted by the afternoon&rsquo;s emotions; it required a
      rest.

      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>owards sunset the
      fair itself became quiescent. It was the hour for the dancing to begin. At
      one side of the village of tents a space had been roped off. Acetylene
      lamps, hung round it on posts, cast a piercing white light. In one corner
      sat the band, and, obedient to its scraping and blowing, two or three
      hundred dancers trampled across the dry ground, wearing away the grass
      with their booted feet. Round this patch of all but daylight, alive with
      motion and noise, the night seemed preternaturally dark. Bars of light
      reached out into it, and every now and then a lonely figure or a couple of
      lovers, interlaced, would cross the bright shaft, flashing for a moment
      into visible existence, to disappear again as quickly and surprisingly as
      they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis stood by the entrance of the enclosure, watching the swaying,
      shuffling crowd. The slow vortex brought the couples round and round again
      before him, as though he were passing them in review. There was Priscilla,
      still wearing her queenly toque, still encouraging the villagers&mdash;this
      time by dancing with one of the tenant farmers. There was Lord Moleyn, who
      had stayed on to the disorganised, passoverish meal that took the place of
      dinner on this festal day; he one-stepped shamblingly, his bent knees more
      precariously wobbly than ever, with a terrified village beauty. Mr. Scogan
      trotted round with another. Mary was in the embrace of a young farmer of
      heroic proportions; she was looking up at him, talking, as Denis could
      see, very seriously. What about? he wondered. The Malthusian League,
      perhaps. Seated in the corner among the band, Jenny was performing wonders
      of virtuosity upon the drums. Her eyes shone, she smiled to herself. A
      whole subterranean life seemed to be expressing itself in those loud
      rat-tats, those long rolls and flourishes of drumming. Looking at her,
      Denis ruefully remembered the red notebook; he wondered what sort of a
      figure he was cutting now. But the sight of Anne and Gombauld swimming
      past&mdash;Anne with her eyes almost shut and sleeping, as it were, on the
      sustaining wings of movement and music&mdash;dissipated these
      preoccupations. Male and female created He them...There they were, Anne
      and Gombauld, and a hundred couples more&mdash;all stepping harmoniously
      together to the old tune of Male and Female created He them. But Denis sat
      apart; he alone lacked his complementary opposite. They were all coupled
      but he; all but he...
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody touched him on the shoulder and he looked up. It was Henry
      Wimbush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never showed you our oaken drainpipes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of the ones we
      dug up are lying quite close to here. Would you like to come and see
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis got up, and they walked off together into the darkness. The music
      grew fainter behind them. Some of the higher notes faded out altogether.
      Jenny&rsquo;s drumming and the steady sawing of the bass throbbed on, tuneless
      and meaningless in their ears. Henry Wimbush halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he said, and, taking an electric torch out of his pocket,
      he cast a dim beam over two or three blackened sections of tree trunk,
      scooped out into the semblance of pipes, which were lying forlornly in a
      little depression in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; said Denis, with a rather tepid enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down on the grass. A faint white glare, rising from behind a belt
      of trees, indicated the position of the dancing-floor. The music was
      nothing but a muffled rhythmic pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad,&rdquo; said Henry Wimbush, &ldquo;when this function comes at last
      to an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know how it is,&rdquo; Mr. Wimbush continued, &ldquo;but the spectacle of
      numbers of my fellow-creatures in a state of agitation moves in me a
      certain weariness, rather than any gaiety or excitement. The fact is, they
      don&rsquo;t very much interest me. They&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t in my line. You follow me? I
      could never take much interest, for example, in a collection of postage
      stamps. Primitives or seventeenth-century books&mdash;yes. They are my
      line. But stamps, no. I don&rsquo;t know anything about them; they&rsquo;re not my
      line. They don&rsquo;t interest me, they give me no emotion. It&rsquo;s rather the
      same with people, I&rsquo;m afraid. I&rsquo;m more at home with these pipes.&rdquo; He
      jerked his head sideways towards the hollowed logs. &ldquo;The trouble with the
      people and events of the present is that you never know anything about
      them. What do I know of contemporary politics? Nothing. What do I know of
      the people I see round about me? Nothing. What they think of me or of
      anything else in the world, what they will do in five minutes&rsquo; time, are
      things I can&rsquo;t guess at. For all I know, you may suddenly jump up and try
      to murder me in a moment&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; Mr. Wimbush continued, &ldquo;the little I know about your past is
      certainly reassuring. But I know nothing of your present, and neither you
      nor I know anything of your future. It&rsquo;s appalling; in living people, one
      is dealing with unknown and unknowable quantities. One can only hope to
      find out anything about them by a long series of the most disagreeable and
      boring human contacts, involving a terrible expense of time. It&rsquo;s the same
      with current events; how can I find out anything about them except by
      devoting years to the most exhausting first-hand study, involving once
      more an endless number of the most unpleasant contacts? No, give me the
      past. It doesn&rsquo;t change; it&rsquo;s all there in black and white, and you can
      get to know about it comfortably and decorously and, above all, privately&mdash;by
      reading. By reading I know a great deal of Caesar Borgia, of St. Francis,
      of Dr. Johnson; a few weeks have made me thoroughly acquainted with these
      interesting characters, and I have been spared the tedious and revolting
      process of getting to know them by personal contact, which I should have
      to do if they were living now. How gay and delightful life would be if one
      could get rid of all the human contacts! Perhaps, in the future, when
      machines have attained to a state of perfection&mdash;for I confess that I
      am, like Godwin and Shelley, a believer in perfectibility, the
      perfectibility of machinery&mdash;then, perhaps, it will be possible for
      those who, like myself, desire it, to live in a dignified seclusion,
      surrounded by the delicate attentions of silent and graceful machines, and
      entirely secure from any human intrusion. It is a beautiful thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; Denis agreed. &ldquo;But what about the desirable human contacts,
      like love and friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black silhouette against the darkness shook its head. &ldquo;The pleasures
      even of these contacts are much exaggerated,&rdquo; said the polite level voice.
      &ldquo;It seems to me doubtful whether they are equal to the pleasures of
      private reading and contemplation. Human contacts have been so highly
      valued in the past only because reading was not a common accomplishment
      and because books were scarce and difficult to reproduce. The world, you
      must remember, is only just becoming literate. As reading becomes more and
      more habitual and widespread, an ever-increasing number of people will
      discover that books will give them all the pleasures of social life and
      none of its intolerable tedium. At present people in search of pleasure
      naturally tend to congregate in large herds and to make a noise; in future
      their natural tendency will be to seek solitude and quiet. The proper
      study of mankind is books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think that it may be,&rdquo; said Denis; he was wondering if Anne
      and Gombauld were still dancing together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of which,&rdquo; said Mr. Wimbush, with a sigh, &ldquo;I must go and see if
      all is well on the dancing-floor.&rdquo; They got up and began to walk slowly
      towards the white glare. &ldquo;If all these people were dead,&rdquo; Henry Wimbush
      went on, &ldquo;this festivity would be extremely agreeable. Nothing would be
      pleasanter than to read in a well-written book of an open-air ball that
      took place a century ago. How charming! one would say; how pretty and how
      amusing! But when the ball takes place to-day, when one finds oneself
      involved in it, then one sees the thing in its true light. It turns out to
      be merely this.&rdquo; He waved his hand in the direction of the acetylene
      flares. &ldquo;In my youth,&rdquo; he went on after a pause, &ldquo;I found myself, quite
      fortuitously, involved in a series of the most phantasmagorical amorous
      intrigues. A novelist could have made his fortune out of them, and even if
      I were to tell you, in my bald style, the details of these adventures, you
      would be amazed at the romantic tale. But I assure you, while they were
      happening&mdash;these romantic adventures&mdash;they seemed to me no more
      and no less exciting than any other incident of actual life. To climb by
      night up a rope-ladder to a second-floor window in an old house in Toledo
      seemed to me, while I was actually performing this rather dangerous feat,
      an action as obvious, as much to be taken for granted, as&mdash;how shall
      I put it?&mdash;as quotidian as catching the 8.52 from Surbiton to go to
      business on a Monday morning. Adventures and romance only take on their
      adventurous and romantic qualities at second-hand. Live them, and they are
      just a slice of life like the rest. In literature they become as charming
      as this dismal ball would be if we were celebrating its tercentenary.&rdquo;
       They had come to the entrance of the enclosure and stood there, blinking
      in the dazzling light. &ldquo;Ah, if only we were!&rdquo; Henry Wimbush added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne and Gombauld were still dancing together.

      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was after ten
      o&rsquo;clock. The dancers had already dispersed and the last lights were being
      put out. To-morrow the tents would be struck, the dismantled
      merry-go-round would be packed into waggons and carted away. An expanse of
      worn grass, a shabby brown patch in the wide green of the park, would be
      all that remained. Crome Fair was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the edge of the pool two figures lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Anne was saying in a breathless whisper, leaning backwards,
      turning her head from side to side in an effort to escape Gombauld&rsquo;s
      kisses. &ldquo;No, please. No.&rdquo; Her raised voice had become imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld relaxed his embrace a little. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden effort Anne freed herself. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried to take the most unfair advantage of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfair advantage?&rdquo; echoed Gombauld in genuine surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, unfair advantage. You attack me after I&rsquo;ve been dancing for two
      hours, while I&rsquo;m still reeling drunk with the movement, when I&rsquo;ve lost my
      head, when I&rsquo;ve got no mind left but only a rhythmical body! It&rsquo;s as bad
      as making love to someone you&rsquo;ve drugged or intoxicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gombauld laughed angrily. &ldquo;Call me a White Slaver and have done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;I am now completely sobered, and if you try and
      kiss me again I shall box your ears. Shall we take a few turns round the
      pool?&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;The night is delicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer Gombauld made an irritated noise. They paced off slowly, side
      by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I like about the painting of Degas...&rdquo; Anne began in her most
      detached and conversational tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn Degas!&rdquo; Gombauld was almost shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where he stood, leaning in an attitude of despair against the parapet
      of the terrace, Denis had seen them, the two pale figures in a patch of
      moonlight, far down by the pool&rsquo;s edge. He had seen the beginning of what
      promised to be an endless passionate embracement, and at the sight he had
      fled. It was too much; he couldn&rsquo;t stand it. In another moment, he felt,
      he would have burst into irrepressible tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dashing blindly into the house, he almost ran into Mr. Scogan, who was
      walking up and down the hall smoking a final pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, catching him by the arm; dazed and hardly
      conscious of what he was doing or where he was, Denis stood there for a
      moment like a somnambulist. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan went on. &ldquo;you
      look disturbed, distressed, depressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis shook his head without replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worried about the cosmos, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Scogan patted him on the arm. &ldquo;I know
      the feeling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most distressing symptom. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the point
      of it all? All is vanity. What&rsquo;s the good of continuing to function if
      one&rsquo;s doomed to be snuffed out at last along with everything else?&rsquo; Yes,
      yes. I know exactly how you feel. It&rsquo;s most distressing if one allows
      oneself to be distressed. But then why allow oneself to be distressed?
      After all, we all know that there&rsquo;s no ultimate point. But what difference
      does that make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the somnambulist suddenly woke up. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said, blinking
      and frowning at his interlocutor. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Then breaking away he dashed up
      the stairs, two steps at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scogan ran to the foot of the stairs and called up after him. &ldquo;It
      makes no difference, none whatever. Life is gay all the same, always,
      under whatever circumstances&mdash;under whatever circumstances,&rdquo; he
      added, raising his voice to a shout. But Denis was already far out of
      hearing, and even if he had not been, his mind to-night was proof against
      all the consolations of philosophy. Mr. Scogan replaced his pipe between
      his teeth and resumed his meditative pacing. &ldquo;Under any circumstances,&rdquo; he
      repeated to himself. It was ungrammatical to begin with; was it true? And
      is life really its own reward? He wondered. When his pipe had burned
      itself to its stinking conclusion he took a drink of gin and went to bed.
      In ten minutes he was deeply, innocently asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis had mechanically undressed and, clad in those flowered silk pyjamas
      of which he was so justly proud, was lying face downwards on his bed. Time
      passed. When at last he looked up, the candle which he had left alight at
      his bedside had burned down almost to the socket. He looked at his watch;
      it was nearly half-past one. His head ached, his dry, sleepless eyes felt
      as though they had been bruised from behind, and the blood was beating
      within his ears a loud arterial drum. He got up, opened the door, tiptoed
      noiselessly along the passage, and began to mount the stairs towards the
      higher floors. Arrived at the servants&rsquo; quarters under the roof, he
      hesitated, then turning to the right he opened a little door at the end of
      the corridor. Within was a pitch-dark cupboard-like boxroom, hot, stuffy,
      and smelling of dust and old leather. He advanced cautiously into the
      blackness, groping with his hands. It was from this den that the ladder
      went up to the leads of the western tower. He found the ladder, and set
      his feet on the rungs; noiselessly, he lifted the trap-door above his
      head; the moonlit sky was over him, he breathed the fresh, cool air of the
      night. In a moment he was standing on the leads, gazing out over the dim,
      colourless landscape, looking perpendicularly down at the terrace seventy
      feet below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had he climbed up to this high, desolate place? Was it to look at the
      moon? Was it to commit suicide? As yet he hardly knew. Death&mdash;the
      tears came into his eyes when he thought of it. His misery assumed a
      certain solemnity; he was lifted up on the wings of a kind of exaltation.
      It was a mood in which he might have done almost anything, however
      foolish. He advanced towards the farther parapet; the drop was sheer there
      and uninterrupted. A good leap, and perhaps one might clear the narrow
      terrace and so crash down yet another thirty feet to the sun-baked ground
      below. He paused at the corner of the tower, looking now down into the
      shadowy gulf below, now up towards the rare stars and the waning moon. He
      made a gesture with his hand, muttered something, he could not afterwards
      remember what; but the fact that he had said it aloud gave the utterance a
      peculiarly terrible significance. Then he looked down once more into the
      depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ARE you doing, Denis?&rdquo; questioned a voice from somewhere very close
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis uttered a cry of frightened surprise, and very nearly went over the
      parapet in good earnest. His heart was beating terribly, and he was pale
      when, recovering himself, he turned round in the direction from which the
      voice had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the profound shadow that slept under the eastern parapet of the tower,
      he saw something he had not previously noticed&mdash;an oblong shape. It
      was a mattress, and someone was lying on it. Since that first memorable
      night on the tower, Mary had slept out every evening; it was a sort of
      manifestation of fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gave me a fright,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to wake up and see you waving your
      arms and gibbering there. What on earth were you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis laughed melodramatically. &ldquo;What, indeed!&rdquo; he said. If she hadn&rsquo;t
      woken up as she did, he would be lying in pieces at the bottom of the
      tower; he was certain of that, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t got designs on me, I hope?&rdquo; Mary inquired, jumping too rapidly
      to conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here,&rdquo; said Denis, laughing more bitterly and
      artificially than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS the matter, Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the edge of the mattress, and for all reply went on
      laughing in the same frightful and improbable tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later he was reposing with his head on Mary&rsquo;s knees, and she, with
      an affectionate solicitude that was wholly maternal, was running her
      fingers through his tangled hair. He had told her everything, everything:
      his hopeless love, his jealousy, his despair, his suicide&mdash;as it were
      providentially averted by her interposition. He had solemnly promised
      never to think of self-destruction again. And now his soul was floating in
      a sad serenity. It was embalmed in the sympathy that Mary so generously
      poured. And it was not only in receiving sympathy that Denis found
      serenity and even a kind of happiness; it was also in giving it. For if he
      had told Mary everything about his miseries, Mary, reacting to these
      confidences, had told him in return everything, or very nearly everything,
      about her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mary!&rdquo; He was very sorry for her. Still, she might have guessed that
      Ivor wasn&rsquo;t precisely a monument of constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;one must put a good face on it.&rdquo; She wanted to
      cry, but she wouldn&rsquo;t allow herself to be weak. There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; asked Denis hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;do you really think that
      she...that Gombauld...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; Mary answered decisively. There was another long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do about it,&rdquo; he said at last, utterly dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go away,&rdquo; advised Mary. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the safest thing, and the most
      sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve arranged to stay here three weeks more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must concoct an excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am,&rdquo; said Mary, who was recovering all her firm self-possession.
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go on like this, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t go on like this,&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immensely practical, Mary invented a plan of action. Startlingly, in the
      darkness, the church clock struck three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go to bed at once,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea it was so late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis clambered down the ladder, cautiously descended the creaking stairs.
      His room was dark; the candle had long ago guttered to extinction. He got
      into bed and fell asleep almost at once.

      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>enis had been
      called, but in spite of the parted curtains he had dropped off again into
      that drowsy, dozy state when sleep becomes a sensual pleasure almost
      consciously savoured. In this condition he might have remained for another
      hour if he had not been disturbed by a violent rapping at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he mumbled, without opening his eyes. The latch clicked, a hand
      seized him by the shoulder and he was rudely shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyelids blinked painfully apart, and he saw Mary standing over him,
      bright-faced and earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;You must go and send the telegram. Don&rsquo;t you
      remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; He threw off the bed-clothes; his tormentor retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis dressed as quickly as he could and ran up the road to the village
      post office. Satisfaction glowed within him as he returned. He had sent a
      long telegram, which would in a few hours evoke an answer ordering him
      back to town at once&mdash;on urgent business. It was an act performed, a
      decisive step taken&mdash;and he so rarely took decisive steps; he felt
      pleased with himself. It was with a whetted appetite that he came in to
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were rather worried about the cosmos last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denis tried to laugh away the impeachment. &ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; he lightly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan, &ldquo;that I had nothing worse to prey on my mind. I
      should be a happy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is only happy in action,&rdquo; Denis enunciated, thinking of the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the window. Great florid baroque clouds floated high in
      the blue heaven. A wind stirred among the trees, and their shaken foliage
      twinkled and glittered like metal in the sun. Everything seemed
      marvellously beautiful. At the thought that he would soon be leaving all
      this beauty he felt a momentary pang; but he comforted himself by
      recollecting how decisively he was acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Action,&rdquo; he repeated aloud, and going over to the sideboard he helped
      himself to an agreeable mixture of bacon and fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, Denis repaired to the terrace, and, sitting there, raised
      the enormous bulwark of the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; against the possible assaults of Mr.
      Scogan, who showed an unappeased desire to go on talking about the
      Universe. Secure behind the crackling pages, he meditated. In the light of
      this brilliant morning the emotions of last night seemed somehow rather
      remote. And what if he had seen them embracing in the moonlight? Perhaps
      it didn&rsquo;t mean much after all. And even if it did, why shouldn&rsquo;t he stay?
      He felt strong enough to stay, strong enough to be aloof, disinterested, a
      mere friendly acquaintance. And even if he weren&rsquo;t strong enough...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time do you think the telegram will arrive?&rdquo; asked Mary suddenly,
      thrusting in upon him over the top of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis started guiltily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only wondering,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;because there&rsquo;s a very good train at
      3.27, and it would be nice if you could catch it, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully nice,&rdquo; he agreed weakly. He felt as though he were making
      arrangements for his own funeral. Train leaves Waterloo 3.27. No
      flowers...Mary was gone. No, he was blowed if he&rsquo;d let himself be hurried
      down to the Necropolis like this. He was blowed. The sight of Mr. Scogan
      looking out, with a hungry expression, from the drawing-room window made
      him precipitately hoist the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; once more. For a long while he kept it
      hoisted. Lowering it at last to take another cautious peep at his
      surroundings, he found himself, with what astonishment! confronted by
      Anne&rsquo;s faint, amused, malicious smile. She was standing before him,&mdash;the
      woman who was a tree,&mdash;the swaying grace of her movement arrested in
      a pose that seemed itself a movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been standing there?&rdquo; he asked, when he had done gaping
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, about half an hour, I suppose,&rdquo; she said airily. &ldquo;You were so very
      deep in your paper&mdash;head over ears&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t like to disturb
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look lovely this morning,&rdquo; Denis exclaimed. It was the first time he
      had ever had the courage to utter a personal remark of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne held up her hand as though to ward off a blow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bludgeon me,
      please.&rdquo; She sat down on the bench beside him. He was a nice boy, she
      thought, quite charming; and Gombauld&rsquo;s violent insistences were really
      becoming rather tiresome. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wear white trousers?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;I like you so much in white trousers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re at the wash,&rdquo; Denis replied rather curtly. This white-trouser
      business was all in the wrong spirit. He was just preparing a scheme to
      manoeuvre the conversation back to the proper path, when Mr. Scogan
      suddenly darted out of the house, crossed the terrace with clockwork
      rapidity, and came to a halt in front of the bench on which they were
      seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go on with our interesting conversation about the cosmos,&rdquo; he began,
      &ldquo;I become more and more convinced that the various parts of the concern
      are fundamentally discrete...But would you mind, Denis, moving a shade to
      your right?&rdquo; He wedged himself between them on the bench. &ldquo;And if you
      would shift a few inches to the left, my dear Anne...Thank you. Discrete,
      I think, was what I was saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were,&rdquo; said Anne. Denis was speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were taking their after luncheon coffee in the library when the
      telegram arrived. Denis blushed guiltily as he took the orange envelope
      from the salver and tore it open. &ldquo;Return at once. Urgent family
      business.&rdquo; It was too ridiculous. As if he had any family business!
      Wouldn&rsquo;t it be best just to crumple the thing up and put it in his pocket
      without saying anything about it? He looked up; Mary&rsquo;s large blue china
      eyes were fixed upon him, seriously, penetratingly. He blushed more deeply
      than ever, hesitated in a horrible uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your telegram about?&rdquo; Mary asked significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this means I shall
      have to go back to town at once.&rdquo; He frowned at the telegram ferociously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s absurd, impossible,&rdquo; cried Anne. She had been standing by the
      window talking to Gombauld; but at Denis&rsquo;s words she came swaying across
      the room towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s urgent,&rdquo; he repeated desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve only been here such a short time,&rdquo; Anne protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, utterly miserable. Oh, if only she could understand!
      Women were supposed to have intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he must go, he must,&rdquo; put in Mary firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must.&rdquo; He looked at the telegram again for inspiration. &ldquo;You see,
      it&rsquo;s urgent family business,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priscilla got up from her chair in some excitement. &ldquo;I had a distinct
      presentiment of this last night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A distinct presentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere coincidence, no doubt,&rdquo; said Mary, brushing Mrs. Wimbush out of
      the conversation. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very good train at 3.27.&rdquo; She looked at the
      clock on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have nice time to pack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll order the motor at once.&rdquo; Henry Wimbush rang the bell. The funeral
      was well under way. It was awful, awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wretched you should be going,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denis turned towards her; she really did look wretched. He abandoned
      himself hopelessly, fatalistically to his destiny. This was what came of
      action, of doing something decisive. If only he&rsquo;d just let things drift!
      If only...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss your conversation,&rdquo; said Mr. Scogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked at the clock again. &ldquo;I think perhaps you ought to go and
      pack,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obediently Denis left the room. Never again, he said to himself, never
      again would he do anything decisive. Camlet, West Bowlby, Knipswich for
      Timpany, Spavin Delawarr; and then all the other stations; and then,
      finally, London. The thought of the journey appalled him. And what on
      earth was he going to do in London when he got there? He climbed wearily
      up the stairs. It was time for him to lay himself in his coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was at the door&mdash;the hearse. The whole party had assembled to
      see him go. Good-bye, good-bye. Mechanically he tapped the barometer that
      hung in the porch; the needle stirred perceptibly to the left. A sudden
      smile lighted up his lugubrious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It sinks and I am ready to depart,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, quoting Landor with an
      exquisite aptness. He looked quickly round from face to face. Nobody had
      noticed. He climbed into the hearse.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
